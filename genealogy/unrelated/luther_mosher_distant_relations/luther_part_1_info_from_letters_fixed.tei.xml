<lb/>September 10, 1993
<lb/>Hello, Emory,
<lb/>I'm sorry I haven't written you back sooner. And after you've written me so many
<lb/>wonderful letters! After doing some more research, 1 have convinced myself that the
<lb/>George W. Luther that you are descended from is the brother of the Angalina and
<lb/>Mary Luther that 1 am descended from. 1 also think that the Gideon Luther you
<lb/>mentioned is another brother in that family. 1 have also run accross a Martha Luther
<lb/>who is a sister of these all. The approximate birth dates are: Gideon clSlS, Mary
<lb/>1824, Angalina 1807, Martha ?, and George W. 1815. The parents of these siblings
<lb/>still remain a mystery!
<lb/>1 was able to find George W. in a couple of the US Censuses. The 1850 US Census
<lb/>shows him in Chatham, Tioga Co., PA with his wife Catherine and children George
<lb/>Jr. (age 5), and Martin (age 3). In 1860, 1 found the same family in Deerfield, Tioga
<lb/>Co. This time, there were three more children, Augusta, James, and Alonzo. The
<lb/>ages of George and Catherine are incorrect, though. In 1850, George is listed as 45,
<lb/>and in 1860 he is also listed as 45! Caterine is listed as 43 in 1850, but in I860, she is
<lb/>listed as 32, that's 10 years later, but 11 years younger! So there is confusion as to the
<lb/>correct dates of birth.
<lb/>There are two George "W. Luthers (father and son) listed in Luther Family in America
<lb/>who at first glance seem likely candidates for our George, but 1 am sure that neither
<lb/>one is him. There are too many inconsistencies between our George's family and the
<lb/>ones listed in the book. There are enough similarities, however, for me to think that
<lb/>they are related in some way. With a lot of searching and a little luck, 1 think we can
<lb/>tie our family into the Luthers in the book somehow.
<lb/>Please let me know if you find out anything about the parents of George W. Luther!
<lb/>Sincerely,
<lb/>Chris Mosher

<lb/>Christopher A. Mosher
<lb/>42 Ridgeley Avenue
<lb/>Fairfield, Ct. 06430-4408
<lb/>Dear Mr. Mosher:
<lb/>I received your letter of 3, November and have been searching
<lb/>through all my Mosher material for any reference to Luther.
<lb/>I have the book "Decendants Of Hugh Mosher and Rebecca Maxon
<lb/>Through Seven Generations" and the later Revised Edition written by
<lb/>Mildred Chamberlain and Laura Clarenbach. I have corresponded with
<lb/>Laura for several years, actually before they finished the book,
<lb/>but we have not been able to find a place for my Isaac Mosher born
<lb/>1807-8 .
<lb/>When I wrote to George Luther, of the Luther Family Assoc. We
<lb/>had been working on the assumption that my Isaac could be the son
<lb/>of David 5, Mosher (1780-1862). At that time we had two sons who
<lb/>were unnamed and thought they might be Isaac and his brother
<lb/>Ellither (Ellether, Lute, Lete). Then later Laura established the
<lb/>name of one of the sons and it was not Isaac or Ellither. I was so
<lb/>disappointed. I had thought surely this was where he belonged
<lb/>because Isaac named his first son Isaac for himself, and the second
<lb/>son he named David.
<lb/>I have a notation here from Laura which reads:
<lb/>In 1850 census David,age 69 and wife Sarah were with son Wm. G. and
<lb/>family. In same household were as follows:
<lb/>B. (listed under Mosher)? age 57 born Canada. He may be B.Luther,
<lb/>Gideon Luther age 32 born N.Y. evidently brother of Wm Gs wife Mary
<lb/>age 36. If really B. Luther he was probably Mary's Father.
<lb/>Children of David and Betsy:
<lb/>3 sons born between 1800-10C^-41 3 daughters born between 1800-10
<lb/>1 son born 1810-20 2 daughters born between 1810-20
<lb/>1 son born 1825-30 1 daughter born 1820-25
<lb/>The only son who was positively identified is William G. born ca
<lb/>1807 Saratoga; died May 19, 1900 S. Hamilton, Madison Co. N.Y.
<lb/>Death records identify parents as David and betsy.
<lb/>William G. married ffl Mary Luther and #2 Angelina Luther.
<lb/>One of David's daughters may have been Betsy D. of Greenfield who
<lb/>was admitted to the baptist church in Wyoming Co., 1837 died 1841
<lb/>(Foley 4-6: 437).
<pb n="3" facs="#page-002"/><lb/>2 .
<lb/>A very probable son was Rensselear Seneca or (S.R.) born 1817 died
<lb/>1893 and is buried in Niles Valley Cemetery, Tioga Co. Pa. He lived
<lb/>Oswego, Tioga Co. N.Y.1840. Deerfield Tioga Co Pa. 1850-60. Chatham
<lb/>Tioga Co. Pa 1870. The Archives copy of the 1870 census evidently
<lb/>read Seneca as Horace. For wife and children the same as copied.
<lb/>He married Martha Luther, (note: wives of Wm. G. Mosher born 1821
<lb/>N.Y. died 1894 are buried in the same cemetery.
<lb/>Children of Rennsealer:
<lb/>Elizabeth born 1844 N.Y., Mary A. born 1846 N.y. William born 1848
<lb/>Pa. Harvey 1849-50 Pa. Franklin 1856 Pa. Eddy (?) 1859 Pa.
<lb/>The madison County N.Y. probate for Angeline Mosher September 19,
<lb/>1870, (A 572 file 3027 ) of Hamilton. She had no children so her
<lb/>heirs were siblings, or if her heirs were deceased, then their
<lb/>children. A newspaper clipping lists heirs as brother George W.
<lb/>Luther of Knoxville Pa. Sister Martha Mosher of knoxville Pa. and
<lb/>Eliza Jane Stevens of Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
<lb/>Petition for administration named as children of deceased sister
<lb/>Mary Mosher, David Mosher, Julia Ann Douglas, Sarah mosher, Willie
<lb/>Mosher age 16 all of Hamilton. William G. Mosher was served the
<lb/>citat i on.
<lb/>The will of William G. Mosher age 86 (May 20, 1893 named daughter
<lb/>Julia A. Douglas exec, and son David Mosher.
<lb/>You may already have all of the above, but I hope some of it
<lb/>may help you. If I run across any more I will pass it on to you.
<lb/>I have been stuck in one place for so long that it seems I may
<lb/>never find the parents of Isaac- In his probate packet in Ottawa
<lb/>County Kansas I found an old deed dated 1841, Mendon, Monroe co.
<lb/>N.Y.Ellither was listed on the deed with him, which caused me to
<lb/>believe they were brothers, though I have no actual proof of that.
<lb/>They purchased two lots together. Both had children born in the
<lb/>town of Mendon. Then by 1850 Isaac and wife Dorcas (Bennet) were in
<lb/>the town of Perinton, Monroe Co. N.Y. By 1860 they were in
<lb/>Winnebago Co. Wisconsin and bought property there. Dorcas must have
<lb/>died right after 1860 census, because Isaac remarried to Lucy
<lb/>Brando. He was in Kansas by 1865 without Lucy, and died here 1877,
<lb/>Ottawa County, Kansas. In every census record he states that he was
<lb/>born N.Y and his parents were born N.Y. Ellither states that he was
<lb/>born Saratogatown, must be Saratoga county, though I have found
<lb/>nothing further to prove or disprove this. I tried to get the death
<lb/>cert, for Ellither. He was alive in 18 9 2, but I didn't know the
<lb/>exact date. The vital records office in N.Y.raised their search fee
<lb/>and I just couldn't afford to keep paying them to search. We feel
<lb/>certain Ellither died South Br i stnl . N.Y. but didn't get D. Cert.
<lb/>Would appreciate any help you may give me. Sincerely, Jean Robison.

<lb/>October 29, 1992
<lb/>Dear Christopher,
<lb/>The Luther Family in America appears to discuss only one Luther family in the
<lb/>Saratoga area, that of Gideon, page 154. But there could well have been a
<lb/>second one there for the period we're concerned with.
<lb/>It seems unlikely that your Mary, Angalina, George, and Martha could have come
<lb/>from my Gideon; his first wife, Olive Fowler, died in Rhode Island in 1785,
<lb/>before they were born. With his second wife, Mary Jolls, he moved to Saratoga
<lb/>County in 1790, where they continued to build a family. Mary's children, and
<lb/>her age (n) at their birth: Olive (17), Mercy (19), John (20), Hale (27),
<lb/>Jemima (28), Mary (29), Gideon (31), Sarah (37), Alvin (40), Julia (41),
<lb/>Charlotte (43), and Samuel (44).
<lb/>The unlikely fit of your four in there means Angalina would have been born to
<lb/>Mary the same year as my Sarah, and Mary would have been 56 at George W.'s
<lb/>birth, and possibly even older at Martha's. One might consider that with
<lb/>Gideon's fecundity he may have fathered some children by other than his wife,
<lb/>giving them his name. But he was renowned as a hard shell Baptist (see
<lb/>newsletter), and with that reputation to defend this is unlikely. Likewise,
<lb/>to place your four with Gideon, Jr. becomes a similar task. His marriage in
<lb/>1821 leaves only George and Martha eligible.
<lb/>Also enclosed is a letter (complete with my scribblings) I received (and
<lb/>answered) from a Jean Robison of Coffeyville, KS, 12i years ago. She asks
<lb/>about your same Mosher/Luther alliance of Saratoga and Madison counties. Why
<lb/>not write her and see if she's still active; maybe you can help each other.
<lb/>C 62 &lt;&gt;3 bhi
<lb/>One other contact I can recommend is Emory Luther, 8808 West Pavia Street, Las
<lb/>Vegas, Nevada 89117. Emory has been trying for thirty years to carry his
<lb/>lineage back beyond: Emory^ (b. 1927); Laurance^ (b. Tioga, PA 1 Jan 1905);
<lb/>Ernest^ (b. Tioga, PA 30 Dec 1881); Alonzo^ (b. Corning, NY 1856); and George''
<lb/>?Washington Luther (b. 1808/15, d. 1884). Note the Tioga connection.
<lb/>Please, please, advise me of your progress.
<lb/>Yours truly.
<lb/>George Luther
<lb/>Enc. LFN 23.

<lb/>I saw your listing of the Luther Family In America and decided to ask
<lb/>for your help.
<lb/>^ ^ j &amp;3/
<lb/>I have been working on my Mosher line for about ten years and have not
<lb/>been able to find the parentage of m.y Gr. Grandfather Isaac born 1807
<lb/>New York, possibly Saratogatown. ^
<lb/>In eliminating some of the many Moshers living in Saratogatown at that
<lb/>time I have come up with a David Mosher S David k Benjamin 3 Daniel 2
<lb/>Hugh 1. David Jr. had a total of five sons born during the years of IBOO-
<lb/>1825-30. ^
<lb/>The only son who has been positively identified is.William G. born ca
<lb/>■  18o6-7 Saratoga, died May 19, 1900 S. Hamilton, Madison co. , New York,
<lb/>Death records identifies parents as David and Betsy .
<lb/>^ 70 5 ^ ^ ^William G. married Mary Luther and married #2 Angelina' Lusher.
<lb/>It is possible one of the sons could have been Rensselaer Mosher some
<lb/>times referredto as S.R. born 1817 died 1893 and is buried in Niles
<lb/>""Valley Gem. , Tioga Co. Pa. Rensselaer married Martha Luther.
<lb/>David Jr. was in Saratoga 1807-10, Greenfield 1820-30, where (?) 1840,
<lb/>Chatham^ Tioga Co. Pa. I850, Hamilton, Madison Co. New York i860. Th'e
<lb/>first wife of David Jr. was Betsy born ca 1786 died April 25, I837
<lb/>age 51 years, buried St. John Cem. Greenfield New York.
<lb/>Was Betsy a Luther also?
<lb/>David Jr. married #2 Sarah
<lb/>I860. /
<lb/>born about 1790 and still living in
<lb/>In I850 David 69 and Sarah 51 were with son William G. and family. In
<lb/>same household were\^^B. Mosher, could be B. Luther, instead of Mosher,
<lb/>age 57, born Canada .^Gideon Luther age 32 born-New York. Gideon was
<lb/>probably the brother of William Gs\ v/ife Mary age 36.-(.c (!"-
<lb/>Mr. Luther I would really appreciate any help you can give me on this
<lb/>Mosher, Luther line. I reasoned that if the first wife of David Jr. was
<lb/>Betsy Luther, then you may have their children.
<lb/>I have enclosed SASE for your convenience, and will look forward to your.
<lb/>17^4/lfrVOK5-
<lb/>Sincerely, Lfl) I ^
