<lb/>FREDERICK MOSHER CASE FILE# 92-0422
<lb/>JULY 4, 1992 4:00 P.M.
<lb/>EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:
<lb/>The body is that of a 67 inch, 153 pound, Caucasian male who
<lb/>appears compatible with the stated age of 81. There is no external
<lb/>evidence of acute injury. The orbits are free of petechiae. There
<lb/>is no bruising about the mouth. There are no marks on the neck.
<lb/>There are no acute marks on the chest, abdomen, back or extremities.
<lb/>There is a right paramidline remote scar in the lower quadrant
<lb/>of the abdomen. The left arm shows deformity with depression of
<lb/>muscle anterior to the left shoulder. It is uncertain if there
<lb/>is a chronic dislocation of the bone.
<lb/>INTERNAL EXAMINATION:
<lb/>The scalp is without bruise over an unbroken calvarium. The
<lb/>1,530 gram brain has bilaterally symmetry with a clear meningeal
<lb/>surface. The meninges are clear. There is some increase in width
<lb/>of sulci but the gyri do not appear excessively narrowed. Multiple
<lb/>sections shows a uniform gray matter ribbon and symmetric deep
<lb/>gray structures without focal discoloration or loss of tissue.
<lb/>The intracranial vasculature is without obstruction. The cerebellar
<lb/>folia are full. The pons and medulla are without discoloration.
<lb/>The soft tissues of the anterior neck on layered dissection
<lb/>are without discoloration. There is no fracture of the larynx
<lb/>2
<pb n="12" facs="#page-011"/>
<lb/>FREDERICK MOSHER CASE FILE# 92-0422
<lb/>or the hyoid and no hemorrhagic discoloration of the soft tissues
<lb/>adjacent to pressure points deep thereto. The epiglottis is free
<lb/>of petechiae. There is no foreign material in the airway and no
<lb/>mucus plugging of the airway. The thyroid is a normal size, shape,
<lb/>texture and location. The precervical fascia is without
<lb/>discoloration and the bony structure of the neck is stable.
<lb/>The chest wall is free of acute injury.
<lb/>The 580 gram heart shows concentric thickening of the left
<lb/>ventricle. There is a normal coronary distribution with extensive
<lb/>calcific atheromatous involvement of all three major coronary
<lb/>vessels with areas of reduction in lumen to pinpoint dimension
<lb/>or less. There is no superimposed thrombus visible. The highest
<lb/>degree of obstruction is in the proximal course of the vessels.
<lb/>The myocardium is red over the anterior wall and the septxim. The
<lb/>posterior wall of the left ventricle and the obtuse margin has
<lb/>a mottling yellow on red of the basic red color elsewhere in the
<lb/>myocardium. An estimated 40% of the myocardium on cut section
<lb/>is involved from the apex to the base of the ventricle. The valves
<lb/>are well formed. The aorta has dilatation to an estimated 3
<lb/>centimeter width distal to the aortic valve. The distal aorta
<lb/>above the iliac bifurcation has concentric calcific atheromatous
<lb/>deposit with an aneurysmal bulge estimated at 3 to 4 centimeters
<lb/>in maximum dimension.
<pb n="13" facs="#page-012"/>
<lb/>FREDERICK MOSHER CASE FILE# 92-0422
<lb/>The 550 gram right lung and 500 gram left lung have a wet
<lb/>tissue with a foamy serous ooze expressible from the cut surface.
<lb/>The airways are free of foreign material. There is no lumpiness
<lb/>of texture. Alveolar size, to gro^s examination, appears slightly
<lb/>enlarged. There is mild black deposit visible in the pleural
<lb/>lymphatic distribution. The vessels are free of ante mortem
<lb/>thrombus.
<lb/>The 1,350 gram liver has a nutmeg appearance on section with
<lb/>a copious sanguinous ooze from the cut surface. There is no
<lb/>intrinsic nodularity. There are five smooth impressions in the
<lb/>surface of the liver forming parallel lines of depression going
<lb/>from the dome to the acute margin at approximate right angles to
<lb/>the ribs. The gallbladder is present and contains a thin bile
<lb/>free of calculi. The extrahepatic biliary tree is without
<lb/>obstruction.
<lb/>The spleen is in a mass of adhesions in the left upper quadrant
<lb/>and is diminutive and soft. It is estimated at 50 grams with a
<lb/>pulpy red tissue with a barely apparent white pulp.
<lb/>The esophagus is without ulceration or discoloration. The
<lb/>gastric mucosa shows no ulceration of acute nature and no
<lb/>discoloration of the mucosa. The small and large bowel have some
<lb/>fibrous adhesions of the serosal surfaces but otherwise are without
<lb/>discoloration or intrinsic mucosal lesion.
<pb n="14" facs="#page-013"/>
<lb/>FREDERICK MOSHER CASE FILE# 92-0422

<lb/>a red central region. Z'

<lb/>fine distinct cortical grain. There is a uniform cortical thickness
<lb/>estimated at 0.5 centimeters. The papillae are without ulceration
<lb/>or calculus and the ureters without dilatation go into a bladder
<lb/>which contains and estimated 3 to 5 milliliters of a cloudy urine
<lb/>over a very trabeculated mucosa with occasional diverticular
<lb/>outpouchings of the mucosa. The prostate is markedly enlarged
<lb/>with an estimated 6 centimeter width and is a mass of nodules of
<lb/>&gt; - • - ■ .•
<lb/>Variable texture, some of which are partially calcified. The
<lb/>nodules are up to 1 centimeter in dimension and occasional nodules
