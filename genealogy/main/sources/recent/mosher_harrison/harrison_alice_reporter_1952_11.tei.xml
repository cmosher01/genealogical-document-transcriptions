<lb/>Patterns Of Action
<lb/>STAMPS TELL A STORY
<lb/>Gordon Sturge, Coto-Meridian
<lb/>We have found the use of stamps and
<lb/>stamp collections a very successful
<lb/>way to arouse interest in the social
<lb/>studies.
<lb/>To begin the work with stamps
<lb/>the teacher may tell briefly the story
<lb/>behind several recently issued
<lb/>stamps. The information may also be
<lb/>presented by arranging a bulletin
<lb/>board display of neatly mounted
<lb/>stamps with a carefully-worded com
<lb/>mentary under each. A stamp collec
<lb/>tor in the class (and almost every
<lb/>class has one) will probably be glad
<lb/>to show off his collection and ex
<lb/>plain what he knows about the story
<lb/>behind each stamp. The important
<lb/>part of the project comes when each
<lb/>student writes up the history repre
<lb/>sented by each of five different
<lb/>stamps. One stamp is then selected
<lb/>from each pupil's work to go into a
<lb/>mimeographed booklet of fifty select
<lb/>ed stamps. Each pupil's name ap
<lb/>pears just under his stamp mounted
<lb/>in the top center of the account. In
<lb/>this way each pupil has his name in
<lb/>the stapled, mimeographed booklet.
<lb/>He will be anxious to have a book
<lb/>because not only his name but also
<lb/>all his classmates' names will be in
<lb/>the book. Each student may make an
<lb/>original cover for his book.
<lb/>Numerous noncomitant learnings
<lb/>may result from this project such as
<lb/>an intelligent awareness of the work
<lb/>ings of our post office department,
<lb/>the ways of carrying the mail, stamp
<lb/>cancellations, as well as a know
<lb/>ledge of the lives of various presi
<lb/>dents, and a sense of participation
<lb/>in one of the country's most impor
<lb/>tant activities which affects every
<lb/>one of America's 154 million people.
<lb/>SAFETY FIRST
<lb/>Elizabeth M. Scarr
<lb/>North Syracuse
<lb/>Last year nearly 5000 people lost
<lb/>their lives in home accidents due
<lb/>to fire.
<lb/>My home nursing class felt that
<lb/>this figure was high enough to war
<lb/>rant serious attention. We decided
<lb/>to embroider FIRE in large red let
<lb/>ters on the fire blanket which always
<lb/>hangs next our stove. Then we
<lb/>soaked it in a flame retardent solu
<lb/>tion consisting of eight ounces of
<lb/>borax crystals, seven ounces of
<lb/>boric acid and one gallongof water.
<lb/>We tested our experiment by touch
<lb/>ing a lighted match to the corner of
<lb/>the blanket. The solution really
<lb/>worked.
<lb/>Later our school custodian talk
<lb/>ed with us about the various kinds
<lb/>of fire extinguishers available and
<lb/>demonstrated the use of the soda-
<lb/>acid and carbon dioxide extinguish
<lb/>ers which are located in our school.
<lb/>The girls all agreed that this ex
<lb/>perience was one that they will put
<lb/>to use in their homes.

<lb/>Editorial Comment
<lb/>FUZZ AND SUBSTANCE
<lb/>Ruth Anderson was confused, Why
<lb/>not? Yes, it had been a pretty good
<lb/>meeting. The junior high teachers
<lb/>had been talking about ways in which
<lb/>they could work more closely togeth
<lb/>er.
<lb/>.Suzanne Quandt had been nice
<lb/>about it. "Could you give me some
<lb/>help, Ruth, with my pupils in math
<lb/>who are having reading difficulties?
<lb/>I find they just can't understand some
<lb/>of the problems ~ even though they
<lb/>can often work them out correctly,
<lb/>once they know what is wanted."
<lb/>The new social studies teacher,
<lb/>Jim Beyer, had described some of
<lb/>the activities for individuals and
<lb/>small groups which he was trying
<lb/>with his youngsters. "There are
<lb/>lots of ways I'd like to cooperate
<lb/>with you in your English work,
<lb/>Ruth," he'd said.
<lb/>"In a way science underlies our
<lb/>whole curriculum at the eighth grade
<lb/>level," Ralph Agostini had argued.
<lb/>"There's the whole history of the
<lb/>development of science which ties
<lb/>in with your social studies work,
<lb/>Jim. And look at the math the kids
<lb/>need to know to do simple experi
<lb/>ments.
<lb/>" Then in your work in English,"
<lb/>Ralph had gone on, speaking to Ruth,
<lb/>" look at the field we have for the
<lb/>kids to study science fiction or arti
<lb/>cles on science or biographies of
<lb/>Steinmetz and others. It would be a
<lb/>cinch for us to work together."
<lb/>But Fran Johnson, the super
<lb/>visor, had been exuberant.
<lb/>"This sounds swell, people,"
<lb/>Fran had said. "This sounds to me
<lb/>like the beginning of the core cur
<lb/>riculum I've been talking about "
<lb/>She sure had, Ruth thought. Ever
<lb/>since she'd arrived on the scene she
<lb/>had seemed bent on establishing
<lb/>what she called the core curriculum
<lb/>in the junior high schcjol.
<lb/>But what exactly it was nobody
<lb/>seemed to know. They all had dif
<lb/>ferent ideas.
<lb/>And Fran wasn't the only one,
<lb/>either.
<lb/>Mr. McGrath, the principal,
<lb/>seemed to want a core curriculum,
<lb/>too. The trouble was that he ap
<lb/>peared to mean something quite dif
<lb/>ferent fi-ora what Fran Johnson had
<lb/>in mind.
<lb/>And the home ec teacher and the
<lb/>shop man both pointed out how their
<lb/>subjects would fit very well into
<lb/>this core curriculum whatever it was
<lb/>that they meant by it.
<lb/>Ruth didn't think she was quite
<lb/>hanging back either. She hadn't
<lb/>been asleep these last few years.
<lb/>She'd done some reading. She'd gone
<lb/>to the zone meetings. She'd used
<lb/>her visiting days to observe some
<lb/>English teachers down the valley.
<lb/>She'd taken some work in summer
<lb/>session, too. She knew that the core
<lb/>curriculum was being more widely
<lb/>tried,
<lb/>But no three people who talked
<lb/>about it seemed to agree on what it
<lb/>was.
<lb/>Then, at the end of the meeting
<lb/>Fran Johnson, the supervisor, came
<pb n="4" facs="#page-003"/>
<lb/>Editorial Comment
<lb/>out with this: "I hope, Ruth, that
<lb/>you'll be able to implement the com
<lb/>mittee's proposals for workshop type
<lb/>of teaching in your part of our core
<lb/>curriculum. "
<lb/>Ruth did a double-take on that
<lb/>oneo But she stifled her "Huh?" and
<lb/>beat it for her room. After all, it
<lb/>was 5 o'clock and she had to get
<lb/>home to help Mary get supper at the
<lb/>apartment.
<lb/>But the sentence -stuck. As if
<lb/>core curriculum wasn't enough. Now
<lb/>it was workshop type of teaching.
<lb/>"What does that mean?" she thought
<lb/>as she peeled the carrots.
<lb/>And that word implement!
<lb/>The administrators loved that
<lb/>one! Implement! "Implanent the
<lb/>committee's proposals!"
<lb/>She thought back to an article
<lb/>she'd been reading recently.
<lb/>After supper she picked it up
<lb/>again. It was in the Saturday Re
<lb/>view for September 20. William D„
<lb/>Grampp had written the lead article
<lb/>on "Words in Public." He'd hit the
<lb/>nail on the head, too.
<lb/>He'd talked about the problem of
<lb/>plain talk in communicating with
<lb/>each other. Then he'd ripped apart
<lb/>our over-use and abuse of certain
<lb/>words,
<lb/>"To use implement as a verb,"
<lb/>he wrote, " and to use it incessantly
<lb/>requires an amount of presumption
<lb/>which is truly an afront. Why must
<lb/>our plans be implemented"^ Are they
<lb/>so fine that they cannot just be
<lb/>carried out' ? "
<lb/>Do they mean " accomplish, ful
<lb/>fil, complete, or carry out," Grampp
<lb/>asked. If so, "let's call a spade a
<lb/>Spade, and that's an implement. "
<lb/>He culled over a number of other
<lb/>words, too. Check, target, concept,
<lb/>firming up, in terms of, level, spell
<lb/>out.
<lb/>Ruth Anderson thought of her
<lb/>own list. Structured, non-Regents;
<lb/>exceptional child, public relations,
<lb/>citizenship education, child-centered,
<lb/>average, progressive.
<lb/>"I wonder," Ruth mused as she
<lb/>turned to marking her papers, "what
<lb/>would happen if more of us would
<lb/>interrupt every so often and ask,
<lb/>' What do you mean? ' or ' How do
<lb/>you define that phrase? ' "

<lb/>JOURNALISM PROFESSOR
<lb/>EMPLOYED AS EDITORIAL
<lb/>CONSULTANT
<lb/>Dr. George L. Bird, Professor of
<lb/>Journalism in the School of Journal
<lb/>ism at Syracuse University, has been
<lb/>employed by the Council to serve as
<lb/>editorial consultant on the staff of
<lb/>THE REPORTER.
<lb/>Dr. Bird will be responsible for
<lb/>final editing of copy and for make-up
<lb/>and format of the Council bi-monthly
<lb/>journal. His services will be avail
<lb/>able for the current Council year, be
<lb/>ginning with the next issue of THE
<lb/>REPORTER.
<lb/>Patterns Of Action
<lb/>is a vote for efficient government"
<lb/>that called for creative ability. The
<lb/>creativeness of the students was
<lb/>further challenged in the develop
<lb/>ment of an assembly program pre
<lb/>sented by the members of the two
<lb/>parties as a conclusion to the cam
<lb/>paign.
<lb/>English teachers worked with all
<lb/>those who presented speeches, sup
<lb/>ervising the writing of the speeches
<lb/>as well as the oral presentation of
<lb/>them. Class discussions were also
<lb/>held after the assembly program to
<lb/>analyze the various speeches as to
<lb/>quality, style of presentation, and
<lb/>persua si vene ss.
<lb/>The voting of the students was a
<lb/>real climax to the entire program in
<lb/>more ways than one. Permission to
<lb/>use a regular voting machine was
<lb/>granted by local authorities, and it
<lb/>was properly setup for the occasion.
<lb/>Preliminary instruction on how to
<lb/>use the machine was given to each
<lb/>social studies class before the stu
<lb/>dents were taken to do their voting.
<lb/>All students operated the machine
<lb/>entirely on their own.
<lb/>It was an excited group of cam
<lb/>paign managers that gathered around
<lb/>that afternoon as the machine was
<lb/>opened for inspection of the results.
<lb/>Examination of the counters on the
<lb/>machine showed clearly that every
<lb/>student had learned the lesson well.
<lb/>Out of 139 individuals who voted,
<lb/>not one made a mistake in using the
<lb/>machine.

<lb/>a manner that would make the pro
<lb/>cedure democratic, practical, and
<lb/>educational. It involved many pupil-
<lb/>to-pupil and teacher-pupil relation
<lb/>ships. It created many opportunities
<lb/>for practical applications in both
<lb/>English and social studies classes
<lb/>as pupils worked individually and in
<lb/>committees toward recognized goals.
<lb/>Members of the student council
<lb/>selected the procedure to be followed
<lb/>in running off the campaign and
<lb/>election. It was unanimously de
<lb/>cided to follow the plan of our
<lb/>national presidential elections. This
<lb/>provided an excellent opportunity
<lb/>for the study of political conventions,
<lb/>registration, and voting in the social
<lb/>studies classes.
<lb/>Each homeroom elected two
<lb/>delegates for the convention meet
<lb/>ings. The result was the formation
<lb/>of two groups of delegates with each
<lb/>homeroom represented on both com
<lb/>mittees. All members of the ninth
<lb/>grade were instructed that they
<lb/>should express their wishes con
<lb/>cerning possible candidates and
<lb/>party name to their delegates.
<lb/>Each group of delegates met,
<lb/>under the supervision of teachers,
<lb/>after a lapse of a few days. In these
<lb/>convention meetings, the parties
<lb/>selected their slates of candidates,
<lb/>party names, party symbols, and
<lb/>campaign managers. The campaign
<lb/>managers were used to plan strategy
<lb/>and secure workers.
<lb/>All ninth grade pupils registered
<lb/>party preference at the time cam
<lb/>paigning began. Registration was
<lb/>supervised by representatives from
<lb/>each party. Ballots used during
<lb/>registration were similar to those
<lb/>used by adults when registering for
<lb/>a real election.
<lb/>The campaign lasted four days.
<lb/>It featured campaign buttons, post
<lb/>ers, speeches, songs, and poems.
<lb/>All of these presented situations

<lb/>FLEXIBILITY COMMITTEE
<lb/>DISTRIBUTES RESOURCE UNITS
<lb/>FOR FIFTH GRADE SOCIAL
<lb/>STUDIES
<lb/>Three resource units for use in teach
<lb/>ing fifth grade social studies have
<lb/>been distributed to all member
<lb/>schools from the Committee on Flex
<lb/>ibility. In addition, schools have
<lb/>received a supplement to the re
<lb/>source units which contains sugges
<lb/>tions for evaluating outcomes in fifth
<lb/>grade social studies. Four addition
<lb/>al units are being duplicated and
<lb/>will be ready for distribution shortly.
<lb/>These units are the first of a
<lb/>group of fifteen resource units for
<lb/>fifth grade social studies which the
<lb/>Committee on Flexibility is'prepar
<lb/>ing. The first seven were assembled
<lb/>lastyear. During the summer a small
<lb/>group of teachers from Council
<lb/>schools worked for three weeks on
<lb/>these seven units, putting them in
<lb/>final form for duplication.
<lb/>Six Teachers
<lb/>These six teachers worked under
<lb/>the general supervision of Miss
<lb/>KathrynHeffernan, Elementary School
<lb/>Supervisor at Marcellus Central
<lb/>School. They were participants in
<lb/>a workshop in citizenship education
<lb/>Patterns Of Action
<lb/>ceive credit both in her class and
<lb/>in reading. Then, too, our science
<lb/>teacher provides bibliographies of
<lb/>library books, magazine articles and
<lb/>other reference materials for each
<lb/>unit of science work. Since some of
<lb/>these sources are more difficult than
<lb/>others, we use them in our divided
<lb/>program. Needless to say, busy
<lb/>students welcome the opportunity to
<lb/>read for science activity credit in
<lb/>reading class. Many of the reading
<lb/>selections I introduce in my English
<lb/>class.
<lb/>The excellent articles in the
<lb/>Junior Scholastic Magazine lend
<lb/>themselves very nicely to outside
<lb/>reading assignments. We find that
<lb/>the students really «ijoy doing the
<lb/>written exercises as well as sum
<lb/>marizing or dramatizing parts of the
<lb/>magazine.
<lb/>This program is neither complete
<lb/>nor perfect. Finding stimulating
<lb/>reading material for fourteen- or
<lb/>fifteen-year-old students with third
<lb/>or fourth grade reading ability is a
<lb/>major problem. We are rewarded in
<lb/>May when another form of standard
<lb/>ized test shows almost evpry student
<lb/>has advanced at least one grade in
<lb/>reading.
<lb/>BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH
<lb/>IMPORTANT PEOPLE
<lb/>Ralph W. Buske, No. Syracuse
<lb/>In order to provide an incentive for
<lb/>use of various research and refer
<lb/>ence materials, and to provide a
<lb/>situation in which children will be
<lb/>come familiar with the lives and ac
<lb/>complishments of outstanding per
<lb/>sons, I have been using a type of
<lb/>interrogation exercise in my seventh
<lb/>and eighth grade social studies
<lb/>classes.
<lb/>For the first five minutes of each
<lb/>social studies period, one student
<lb/>assumes the personality of a well-
<lb/>known figure in current life such as
<lb/>Warren Austin, Jim Thorpe, Queen
<lb/>Elizabeth, Marshall Tito, or John
<lb/>Foster Dulles. The rest of the class
<lb/>does not know the identity of this
<lb/>person. Only one brief clue is given
<lb/>to his identity such as, "I am an
<lb/>American citizen," or "My home is
<lb/>on foreign soil." The clue may be
<lb/>vague but yet give some definite de
<lb/>tail. After this brief hint the stu
<lb/>dents in the class ask questions
<lb/>which can be answered "Yes" or
<lb/>"No" until the person has been
<lb/>identified. The student identifying
<lb/>the person is the "mystery person
<lb/>ality" the next day. That student
<lb/>must familiarize himself with the
<lb/>life of the person he chooses so that
<lb/>he will be able to answer the ques
<lb/>tions of other pupils the following
<lb/>day. Here is a challenge in current
<lb/>events both to individuals and to a
<lb/>whole class.

<lb/>Patterns Of Action
<lb/>The fair lasted three days and
<lb/>was open to all grades from third to
<lb/>ninth. The visitors seemed to enjoy
<lb/>the new books and made many com
<lb/>ments about the displays. Booklists
<lb/>and bookmarks were carried away by
<lb/>every visitor as a reminder of the
<lb/>1952 fair. Parents also had an op
<lb/>portunity to visit the fair and see
<lb/>the puppet show during an open
<lb/>house at the school that week.
<lb/>A READING PROGRAM FOR
<lb/>SEVENTH GRADERS
<lb/>Christine Kobarge
<lb/>Newark High School
<lb/>The seventh grade reading program
<lb/>is being adapted to our own needs.
<lb/>In a class of one hundred thirty-five
<lb/>students, there is a range of read
<lb/>ing ability from the third grade to
<lb/>the tenth grade plus. This calls for
<lb/>a diversified program. During the
<lb/>first month of school a standardized
<lb/>test is given, which, along with the
<lb/>observation of thefoursubjectteach-
<lb/>ers and the accumulative records,
<lb/>determines the grouping of our stu
<lb/>dents. We carry on two quite dif
<lb/>ferent programs: one for students
<lb/>reading below the seventh grade
<lb/>level and the other for students who
<lb/>need an accelerated program to stim
<lb/>ulate their interests.
<lb/>The classes for below-average
<lb/>readers take considerable planning
<lb/>each year. Each student discusses
<lb/>h\s own problems and ways of over
<lb/>coming them with the teacher. His
<lb/>self-confidence is bolstered by doing
<lb/>reading exercises within his ability.
<lb/>For teaching reading skills, we use
<lb/>a text suggested by Dr. Paul Witty
<lb/>of Northwestern University. These
<lb/>students read orally in class as well
<lb/>as listen to stories read by the teach
<lb/>er. Vocabulary drill and concept
<lb/>building are handled along with the
<lb/>stories. We attempt to overcome the
<lb/>oft-mentioned dislike for reading by
<lb/>suggesting comparatively easy li
<lb/>brary books on the students' hobbies
<lb/>and interests. Units on the use of
<lb/>the library, the dictionary and the
<lb/>encyclopedia engender better study
<lb/>habits.
<lb/>The emphasis in our accelerated
<lb/>program is on more challenging read
<lb/>ing selections and a more thought-
<lb/>provoking testing program. Oral
<lb/>reports, dramatizations, discussions,
<lb/>and summaries serve to motivate the
<lb/>average and above-average readers.
<lb/>A library book is the "pass" to
<lb/>reading class. We try to congratu
<lb/>late those students who read their
<lb/>library books whenever they have a
<lb/>little spare time in school.
<lb/>The splendid cooperation of the
<lb/>other teachers facilities correlation
<lb/>within our departments. For example,
<lb/>on occasions the social studies
<lb/>teacher uses the reading class to
<lb/>teach the meanings of difficult words
<lb/>and the concepts necessary to the
<lb/>understanding of certain phases of
<lb/>her work. Besides, she provides
<lb/>each student with lists of library
<lb/>books which supplement other so
<lb/>cial studies activities. The stu
<lb/>dents who report on these books re-

<lb/>On Council Activities
<lb/>which was conducted as part of the
<lb/>summer session at Syracuse Univer
<lb/>sity. The six teachers were as fol
<lb/>lows: Miss Mary Lou Dickinson,
<lb/>Fayetteville-Manlius Central School;
<lb/>Miss Clara M. Evans, Syracuse Pub
<lb/>lic Schools; Miss Marjorie Freland,
<lb/>Sherburne Central School; Mrs. Ur-
<lb/>salaKishman, Solvay Public Schools;
<lb/>Mrs. Veronica Locke, Fayetteville-
<lb/>Manlius Central School; and Miss
<lb/>Ruth Parker, Fayetteville-Manlius
<lb/>Central School. Assisting the group
<lb/>in its work was Mrs. Evelyn Norem,
<lb/>Elementary School Supervisor at the
<lb/>Fayetteville-Manlius Central School.
<lb/>Revisions Called For
<lb/>These units, which parallel the
<lb/>state syllabus, are to be utilized
<lb/>by teachers in any manner they deem
<lb/>best Each teacher is asked to
<lb/>make changes or additions in each
<lb/>unit as she uses it. The comments
<lb/>of each teacher are then to be pooled
<lb/>for each school system and com
<lb/>bined on one copy of each unit. This
<lb/>copy of each unit will be transmitted
<lb/>to the Committee on Flexibility by
<lb/>the chief representative on that
<lb/>Committee from the school system.
<lb/>These suggested changes will then
<lb/>be combined from all member schools
<lb/>and the units will be revised and
<lb/>re-published in a final edition.
<lb/>These final editions will be issued
<lb/>as they are ready, next spring, sum
<lb/>mer, and fall.
<lb/>Units Listed
<lb/>The titles of the fifteen resource
<lb/>units for fifth grade social studies
<lb/>are as follows: 1, Our Global World;
<lb/>II, How the New World Was Discov

<lb/>SIXTH GRADE CITIZENSHIP
<lb/>EDUCATION, PROMOTIONAL
<lb/>POLICY CONCERN COMMITTEE
<lb/>ON FLEXIBILITY
<lb/>The Committee on Flexibility
<lb/>is working in two sections again
<lb/>this year. The sub-committee meet
<lb/>ings are independent of each other
<lb/>and each is concerned with its own
<lb/>problems.
<lb/>The Sub-Committee on Sixth
<lb/>Grade Citizenship Education is work
<lb/>ing on the development of resource
<lb/>units in this area. These units are
<lb/>similar in form to the fifth grade citi
<lb/>zenship education resource units.
<lb/>Outside of the regular meetings,
<lb/>as interim activity. Council schools
<lb/>are concerned with the further devel
<lb/>opment of the fifth grade program in
<lb/>citizenship education. These schools
<lb/>are developing the remaining re
<lb/>source units as individual projects.
<lb/>The Planning Committee revised their
<lb/>original plans to make this possible
<pb n="8" facs="#page-007"/>
<lb/>On Council Activities Patterns Of Action
<lb/>and to facilitate the emphasis on the
<lb/>sixth grade program.
<lb/>The Committee is planning a hu
<lb/>man relations seminar for supervisors
<lb/>and elementary principals. This will
<lb/>be under the direction of Dr. Arthur
<lb/>Combs as was last year's human re
<lb/>lations seminar for chief school ad
<lb/>ministrators. The first meeting of
<lb/>this group is scheduled for February.
<lb/>The Sub-Committee on Promo
<lb/>tional Policy, after an organizational
<lb/>meeting September 28, is seeking to
<lb/>form fundamental philosophy and cri
<lb/>teria in promotional policy. The
<lb/>group is using as consultant William
<lb/>Young, Director of Guidance in Rome.
<lb/>Elections were held in the Pro
<lb/>motional Policy meeting of Septem
<lb/>ber 28 and the following members of
<lb/>the Planning Committee were chosen:
<lb/>Anna L. Murtagh, Solvay, Chairman;
<lb/>Eltha Rowland West Winfield, Chief
<lb/>Recorder, Ethel Moss, Cortland, As
<lb/>sistant Recorder and William Young.
<lb/>The Chairman of the Sub-Commit
<lb/>tee on Sixth Grade Citizenship Edu
<lb/>cation is Mildred C. Webb, Sherburne.
<lb/>Working with six unit-development
<lb/>committees in Citizenship Education
<lb/>are the following co-chairmen: Mary

<lb/>CITIZENSHIP COMMITTEE
<lb/>PLANS THREE STUDIES
<lb/>Sixty representatives of member
<lb/>schools attended the first meeting
<lb/>for the current year of the Committee
<lb/>on Citizenship at Drumlins on No
<lb/>vember 6.
<lb/>Afternoon Session
<lb/>Meeting in small groups during
<lb/>the afternoon session, the members
<lb/>of the Committee selected three
<lb/>problems for study during the bal
<lb/>ance of this year„ The first one is
<lb/>the further development of student
<lb/>participation in various aspects of
<lb/>school life. The second is the con
<lb/>sideration of the desirable citizen
<lb/>ship role of the teacher in community
<lb/>life. The planning and organization
<lb/>of local school-community citizen
<lb/>ship workshops was selected as the
<lb/>third problem for study.
<lb/>Next Meeting Scheduled
<lb/>The next meeting of the Com
<lb/>mittee will be held on Wednesday,
<lb/>December 3, at Drumlins.
<lb/>Felix Describes CEP
<lb/>In the morning session the speak
<lb/>er was Dr. Allai 0. Felix, Coordi
<lb/>nator of Community Projects in the
<lb/>Citizenship Education Project at
<lb/>Teachers College, Columbia Uni
<lb/>versity. Dr. Felix described some
<lb/>of the achievements and procedures
<lb/>of the CEP. A summary of his talk
<lb/>will be presented in the next issue
<lb/>of THE REPORTER.
<lb/>Ceramic lions, tigers, and a panther
<lb/>moved among the trees.
<lb/>The Sport display consisted of
<lb/>a collection of sport books flanked
<lb/>on the sides and back by shinguards,
<lb/>a baseball and bat, and a football
<lb/>and basketball.
<lb/>Small ceramic animals gave at
<lb/>mosphere to the Animals display,
<lb/>many of them being salt and pepper
<lb/>shakers. A rubber dagger, gun, arid
<lb/>magnifying glass brought attention
<lb/>to the Detective Story display, while
<lb/>the Classic and Folk Tale display
<lb/>featured cutout scenes from Alice in
<lb/>Wonderland. Two large size ships
<lb/>gave a salty flavor to the Adventure
<lb/>display, and oddly enough, salt was
<lb/>used as sand in the desert scene for
<lb/>the Western Hero exhibit.
<lb/>The Did You Know? arrangement
<lb/>caused quite a bit of comment. The
<lb/>centerpiece consisted of the world
<lb/>globe. Surrounding it girls placed
<lb/>reference books and signs with such
<lb/>questions as "Did you know you
<lb/>"The Sea Stories Display"
<lb/>could find Tonia Marcini's address
<lb/>in the Endicott Directory?" In order
<lb/>to prove the answer to this question
<lb/>the Endicott Directory was opened
<lb/>to the page where this information
<lb/>could be found. Who's Who in Amer
<lb/>ica, encyclopedias, and other special
<lb/>reference books were featured.
<lb/>Each committee was responsible
<lb/>for all materials which they used in
<lb/>connection with their displays. Bed
<lb/>sheets were used to cover the tables
<lb/>in order to have a uniform-looking
<lb/>display. Each committee was also
<lb/>responsible for compiling a bibliog
<lb/>raphy of books they used in their
<lb/>displays. These lists were mimeo
<lb/>graphed and run off on colored paper.
<lb/>Placed on the tables, they were
<lb/>accessible to those visiting the fair.
<lb/>A fourth grade girl did the illustra
<lb/>tions for these booklets.
<lb/>The art and homeroom teachers
<lb/>were contacted and expressed a de
<lb/>sire to assist in the preparation of
<lb/>a puppet show. The English teacher
<lb/>supervised thewriting of the scripts,
<lb/>while the art teacher assisted the
<lb/>students with the making of the pup
<lb/>pets and the stage. Scenes from
<lb/>"Strawberry Girl" by Lois Lenski
<lb/>and "Bulldog Shell a" by T. F. Hick-
<lb/>ey were dramatized with much suc
<lb/>cess. A bit of comedy was imparted
<lb/>with a quiz show featuring puppets
<lb/>personifying Danny Kaye, Jerry
<lb/>Lewis, and Amos. Such questions
<lb/>as "What kind of animal was Freddy
<lb/>the Pig?" and "In what profession
<lb/>was Freddy the Detective?" brought
<lb/>chuckles from the audience.

<lb/>Patterns Of Action On Council Activities
<lb/>WE HAD A BOOK FAIR
<lb/>Francesco La Sorte
<lb/>George Washington Junior High
<lb/>School, Endicott
<lb/>At one library club meeting early in
<lb/>October I casually asked the group
<lb/>if they would be interestedin putting
<lb/>on a book fair. The response was
<lb/>overwhelming! In amazement, I
<lb/>quickly gathered my composure and
<lb/>tried to answer many of the ques
<lb/>tions thrown at me at one time. If
<lb/>you are familiar with the enthusiasm
<lb/>of junior high school students you
<lb/>will understand my predicament.
<lb/>"Will it be like the one at the
<lb/>Enjoy Club House you had a couple
<lb/>of years ago? "
<lb/>This question surprised me be
<lb/>cause I didn't think they had enjoy
<lb/>ed that exhibit so much. Since most
<lb/>of them were in fourth or fifth grade
<lb/>at the time, the display put on by
<lb/>the Endicott librarian then must
<lb/>have made a lasting impression.
<lb/>"NO," I replied, "it will be a
<lb/>miniature fair here in our library. "
<lb/>"I want to put up a display on
<lb/>sports," cried one.
<lb/>" Me too, " shouted another.
<lb/>A few more chimed in with other
<lb/>ideas. After the children calmed
<lb/>down, it was suggested that they
<lb/>name committees and determine
<lb/>themes for the exhibit. The follow
<lb/>ing themes were approved:
<lb/>Adventure and mystery, jungle
<lb/>stories, animal stories, career stor
<lb/>ies, sports as you like them, nature
<lb/>and science, western heroes, detec-
<lb/>" A Corner of the Book Fair"
<lb/>tive stories, folk tales and the
<lb/>classics, and did you know?
<lb/>Some of the ideas for the dis
<lb/>plays were fantastic and impossible,
<lb/>I thought, but the children were sure
<lb/>their ideas could be carried out. Of
<lb/>course, I couldn't dogmatically say,
<lb/>"No, it can't be done," but I was
<lb/>very skeptical. A week was set
<lb/>aside for meetings of the committee.
<lb/>The Jungle display plagued me most.
<lb/>The committee was going to build a
<lb/>big palm tree and a waterfall for the
<lb/>background My good library tables!
<lb/>After a bit of discussion they real
<lb/>ized that a library table was too
<lb/>Small to house a jungle scene and
<lb/>a display of books too, so the scene
<lb/>was modified. They made a collec
<lb/>tion of jungle books which were
<lb/>placed behind the jungle scene. The
<lb/>scene consisted of green vegetation
<lb/>suggested by green felt, small palm
<lb/>trees made of crepe paper and pipe
<lb/>cleaners, and a waterfall formation
<lb/>made of small flat stones. No water!
<lb/>SECONDARY CURRICULUM
<lb/>COMMITTEE PLANS
<lb/>PUBLICATION WORKSHOP
<lb/>On Wednesday, October 22, 1952,
<lb/>The Committee on Secondary School
<lb/>Curriculum Development met at Drum-
<lb/>lins in Syracuse for a working ses
<lb/>sion on the studies launched during
<lb/>the 1951-52 school year. The pur
<lb/>pose of the meeting was to compile
<lb/>and organize results of the year's
<lb/>study and to plan for a publication
<lb/>workshop during November necessary
<lb/>to put the findings into publication
<lb/>form.
<lb/>The study groups of the commit
<lb/>tee had concentrated on three of the
<lb/>ten "Imperative Needs of Adoles
<lb/>cent Youth": family living, rational
<lb/>thinking, and worthwhile use of lei
<lb/>sure. These three needs had been
<lb/>indicated through a survey of Coun
<lb/>cil member schools a year ago as
<lb/>most in need of study.
<lb/>Prior to the meeting, each of the
<lb/>study groups had issued a progress
<lb/>report here summarized in brief.
<lb/>Study Group I - Family Living
<lb/>"All youth need to understand
<lb/>the significance of the family for the
<lb/>individual and society and the con
<lb/>ditions conducive to successful
<lb/>family life."
<lb/>The basic interests and charac
<lb/>teristics of students in grades 7, 8,
<lb/>and 9 have been studied and listed.
<lb/>Work is still incomplete on grades
<lb/>10, 11, and 12.
<lb/>One of the areas which needs to
<lb/>be investigated more completely is
<lb/>concerned with the skills, attitudes,
<lb/>and understandings which are to be
<lb/>developed in the program of family
<lb/>life education.
<lb/>Several significant lists of avail
<lb/>able materials are in the editing
<lb/>stage at the present time. These
<lb/>include a tabulation of devices now
<lb/>being used in our schools to more
<lb/>effectively meet the need stated
<lb/>above. These devices are divided
<lb/>into those which are used at the
<lb/>junior high school level and those
<lb/>more appropriate for use in the sen
<lb/>ior high school.
<lb/>Rather extensive annotated lists
<lb/>of books of fiction, biographies, and
<lb/>other reference materials have been
<lb/>compiled and are now ready for final
<lb/>editing. These materials were chos
<lb/>en and listed in order to provide the
<lb/>classroom teacher with resource ma
<lb/>terials and other aids suitable for
<lb/>the family life program.
<lb/>Also in the editing stage is a
<lb/>suggested list of desirable behaviors
<lb/>which may be used as a guide for
<lb/>teachers in developing a school-wide
<lb/>program in family living in junior and
<lb/>senior high schools.
<lb/>The committee has studied care
<lb/>fully suggestions of experiences
<lb/>which the school can provide in such
<lb/>a program, and more work will be
<lb/>done in this particular area of study.
<lb/>The problem of evaluating prog
<lb/>ress in the developing of skills, at
<lb/>titudes, understandings, and desir
<lb/>able behaviors was not discussed
<lb/>thoroughly during the past year.
<lb/>24
<pb n="10" facs="#page-009"/>
<lb/>On Council Acfivifies
<lb/>Evaluation will be an important
<lb/>phase of the program, but time did
<lb/>not permit its detailed consideration.
<lb/>A chart has been devised to aid
<lb/>in studying and classifying the top
<lb/>ics in the family life program. An
<lb/>effort was made to consider particu
<lb/>lar needs, interests, and character
<lb/>istics of students at the various
<lb/>grade levels, although much over
<lb/>lapping was found. All the lists now
<lb/>in the editing stage and the other
<lb/>materials in the process of develop
<lb/>ment, while primarily concerned with
<lb/>either the junior or the senior high
<lb/>school program, will be of value to
<lb/>both levels.
<lb/>Study Group II - Rational Thinking
<lb/>Because of the nebulous nature
<lb/>of its study, the group working on
<lb/>the development of rational thinking
<lb/>in the' secondary curriculum encoun
<lb/>tered considerable difficulty in de
<lb/>fining its attack on the problem.
<lb/>However, by December of 1951, the
<lb/>group had developed a concept it
<lb/>considered defensible of what con
<lb/>stitutes rational thinking. The an
<lb/>alysis comprised eight points: dis
<lb/>cerning facts, recognizing problems,
<lb/>thinking soundly, attacking a problem
<lb/>systematically, using analogy if and
<lb/>when valid, making appropriate gen
<lb/>eralizations, proving an attitude of
<lb/>critical mindedness, and drawing and
<lb/>utilizing sound conclusions.
<lb/>From this analysis the committee
<lb/>has begun developing a collection of
<lb/>experiences in investigation, prob
<lb/>lem-finding, and problem solving. It
<lb/>is considering the relation of these
<lb/>experiences to the curriculum, nec
<lb/>essary specific understandings and
<lb/>abilities which underlie rational
<lb/>thinking, and methods of finding the
<lb/>material needed for a study such as
<lb/>this one.
<lb/>Study Group III - Worthwhile Use of
<lb/>Leisure Time
<lb/>Last October this committee be
<lb/>gan to explore the problems involved
<lb/>in helping "all youth to use their
<lb/>leisure time well, to budget it wise
<lb/>ly, balancing activities that yield
<lb/>satisfaction to the individual with
<lb/>those that are socially useful."
<lb/>Since early investigations re
<lb/>vealed a striking lack of available
<lb/>resource material, the group began
<lb/>by describing many practices com
<lb/>mon to the schools represented on
<lb/>the committee. Such factors as the
<lb/>novelty, the opportunity for action,
<lb/>and the chance for recognition were
<lb/>identified in an effort to develop
<lb/>criteria for determining the compara
<lb/>tive value of the various activities.
<lb/>By December the group accepted
<lb/>the philosophy that a good activity
<lb/>is any activity that adds to the phy
<lb/>sical, moral, and mental fiber of a
<lb/>person and that leisure refers to that
<lb/>time not occupied by the demands of
<lb/>the job or the necessities of daily
<lb/>living.
<lb/>An extensive checklist of leisure
<lb/>time activities was developed. In
<lb/>aneffortto provide a fundof success
<lb/>ful practices all committee members
<lb/>were urged to obtain thumbnail
<lb/>sketches of what were considered

<lb/>Patterns Of Actions
<lb/>When the vegetables were full
<lb/>grown and ready to use, the class
<lb/>decided to use part of the vegetables
<lb/>to make a tossed salad. The rest of
<lb/>the vegetables were cooked to illus
<lb/>trate how we can conserve our vita
<lb/>mins as well as use the vitamins
<lb/>which have dissolved in the water.
<lb/>ACTION RESEARCH IN READING
<lb/>Reglna Ryan, South Broad
<lb/>Street School, Norwich
<lb/>We decided to try a simple research
<lb/>project in our sixth grade. The pur
<lb/>pose of this study was to determine
<lb/>to what extent there is growth in read
<lb/>ing when good reading habits and
<lb/>study skills are emphasized in social
<lb/>studies. The unit developed was on
<lb/>Ancient Greece.
<lb/>The effectiveness of this exper
<lb/>imental study was objectively deter
<lb/>mined by gains shown in the Iowa
<lb/>Basic Skills Test, Type B, Work-
<lb/>Study Skills, which was given before
<lb/>and after the five-week study of
<lb/>Greece.
<lb/>Discussion periods were used to
<lb/>formulate problems, organize ideas,
<lb/>raise questions, share experiences,
<lb/>summarize concepts, and evaluate
<lb/>objectives. Committee groups inves
<lb/>tigated specific problems and report
<lb/>ed their findings to the class.
<lb/>General group instruction was
<lb/>given to aid in difficulties in vocab
<lb/>ulary; location of supplementary ma
<lb/>terials; use of supplementary ma
<lb/>terials such as the atlas. World Al
<lb/>manac, supplementary texts, news
<lb/>papers, and weekly magazines; in
<lb/>terpretation of maps, graphs, charts,
<lb/>and tables; organization of material
<lb/>developing techniques of note taking,
<lb/>outlining, and summarizing; critical
<lb/>reading and an appreciation of the
<lb/>need for wide reading; use of the
<lb/>globe; and formulation of generaliza
<lb/>tions based on fact.
<lb/>The gain in work-study skills as
<lb/>measured by the Iowa Basic Skills
<lb/>Test ranged from .2 to 2.1 on the
<lb/>scale provided with the test; the
<lb/>average gain was .64. There was
<lb/>definite growth in reading when read
<lb/>ing habits and specific study skills
<lb/>were emphasized.
<lb/>Many worthwhile values, not ob
<lb/>jectively measured, were evident to
<lb/>the observer. A few of these were
<lb/>shown in the children's discussion
<lb/>groups as they contributed facts from
<lb/>many sources, and questioned ma
<lb/>terial given in references. The
<lb/>children showed independence and
<lb/>ease in studying, ability to take
<lb/>notes effectively and to outline ma
<lb/>terial, and confidence in oral ex
<lb/>pression.
<lb/>(Editor's Note: In trying this kind of
<lb/>experiment again, it would be inter
<lb/>esting to use a matched control
<lb/>group. The control group could be
<lb/>taught the same material without
<lb/>emphasizing reading habits and study
<lb/>skills. A comparison of the before
<lb/>and after test results of the experi
<lb/>mental group with those of the con
<lb/>trol group might give an indication
<lb/>of the relative value of emphasizing
<lb/>reading habits and study skills.)

<lb/>ASSEMBLING SOCIAL
<lb/>STUDIES POSTERS
<lb/>Alice Mosher, Earlville
<lb/>In order to arouse a desire for further
<lb/>reading in social studies, news
<lb/>papers and other sources were used
<lb/>to secure captions for posters de
<lb/>picting the various ways of sending
<lb/>messages. The words, letters, and
<lb/>pictures were cut from the papers
<lb/>and pasted on the posters. The
<lb/>children also made their own tele
<lb/>grams by selecting and cutting out
<lb/>the words, and pasting them on yel
<lb/>low paper which resembled the origi
<lb/>nal telegram. This work was done
<lb/>entirely as an activity at home over
<lb/>a period of one week. The children
<lb/>were interested and produced some
<lb/>very attractive and illustrative pos
<lb/>ters.
<lb/>WHAT PLACE IS THIS?
<lb/>Eugenia M. Baker
<lb/>Lincaln School, Auburn
<lb/>To make review in social studies
<lb/>more interesting, we sometimes use
<lb/>a game of Twenty Questions. The
<lb/>class organizes into two groups. One
<lb/>group thinks of a place we have
<lb/>studied about in social studies. The
<lb/>rest of the class has twenty ques
<lb/>tions to locate the place. Questions
<lb/>must be worded so as to be answered
<lb/>yes or no.
<lb/>This is an example of how the
<lb/>questioning proceeds: Is it land?
<lb/>Is it a city? Is it in our country? Is
<lb/>it in Europe? Is it in Africa? Is it
<lb/>on the Nile River? Is it Cairo?
<lb/>If the group asking the questions
<lb/>can discover the correct answer that
<lb/>group then selects a place and
<lb/>answers the questions of the other
<lb/>group.
<lb/>GARDENS NOW - SALAD LATER
<lb/>Helen Warren, North Syracuse
<lb/>Our fourth grade began a unit on
<lb/>good eating, including what vitamins
<lb/>we need in our diet and why they
<lb/>are so important to us. As a result
<lb/>of our study, the children decided to
<lb/>plant some vegetable gardens.
<lb/>We were fortunate in having three
<lb/>boys in our room whose fathers are
<lb/>truck farmers. Therefore, we were
<lb/>able to get fertilized black soil and
<lb/>boxes in which we could plant our
<lb/>seeds.
<lb/>First, we divided ourselves into
<lb/>sixeswitha chairman for each group.
<lb/>Then each group did a little research
<lb/>to find out what vegetables grew
<lb/>the quickest and easiest in the class
<lb/>room. They discovered that some
<lb/>vegetables need certain special
<lb/>conditions in which to grow, and
<lb/>others can be grown in the class
<lb/>room without too much trouble. They
<lb/>then decided to grow radishes, leaf
<lb/>lettuce, green onions, and carrots.
<lb/>On the day of the planting one
<lb/>child in each group read the direc
<lb/>tions while the others carried them
<lb/>out. Then we carefully watered the
<lb/>plants and set them on the ledge
<lb/>near the windows. Every day a dif
<lb/>ferent child took the responsibility
<lb/>of watering and weeding the gardens.
<lb/>highly desirable practices in their
<lb/>own school. Later this same request
<lb/>was made to all schools in the
<lb/>Council.
<lb/>Within the school leisure time
<lb/>experiences are made available to
<lb/>pupils through homeroom organiza
<lb/>tions, activity periods, noon hour
<lb/>programs, after school meetings and
<lb/>practice sessions, study units with
<lb/>the regular class program, and through
<lb/>various groupings in the fields of
<lb/>music, art, science, homemaking and
<lb/>industrial arts. Such related phases
<lb/>of the leisure time program as the
<lb/>problem of transportation, the ques
<lb/>tion of eligibility, the need to stim
<lb/>ulate certain pupils to participate
<lb/>more widely, and the limitation of
<lb/>those who spread their energies too
<lb/>widely, were subjects of group dis
<lb/>cussion.
<lb/>In the spring of 1952 it became
<lb/>evident that more time than was then
<lb/>available would be required to as
<lb/>semble this material into some form
<lb/>of an evaluative instrument. Some
<lb/>thou^t was given to the scope and
<lb/>format of the proposed tool that is
<lb/>intended to help schools identify
<lb/>their own strengths and weaknesses
<lb/>in the area of the wise use of leisure
<lb/>time. The last meeting closed with
<lb/>a  request that each member seek
<lb/>further examples of eminently suc
<lb/>cessful practices.
<lb/>In addition, a questionnaire has
<lb/>been circulated to each Council mem
<lb/>ber school this fall seeking pertinent
<lb/>information concerning leisure time
<lb/>attitudes and practices from ten stu
<lb/>dents a ndten teachers in each school.
<lb/>The response has been highly grati
<lb/>fying and has supplied a rich source
<lb/>of material to the committee which,
<lb/>it is expected, will be of great value
<lb/>to other member schools. For the re
<lb/>sponse, especially on unavoidably
<lb/>short notice, the committee wishes
<lb/>to thank the schools, administrators,
<lb/>teachers, and students who contribu
<lb/>ted so well.
<lb/>Further Plans of Committees
<lb/>At the October 22 meeting each
<lb/>study group developed a tentative
<lb/>table of contents for its publication,
<lb/>identified gaps in the collected ma
<lb/>terial and made specific assignments
<lb/>of responsibility to eliminate them,
<lb/>planned for any further necessary in
<lb/>dividual group meetings, and planned
<lb/>for a workshop organization which
<lb/>would best suit its needs and avail
<lb/>ability.
<lb/>November Workshops
<lb/>The study group on family living
<lb/>will meet all day from 10:00 a.m. on
<lb/>November 20, 21, and, possibly, 22.
<lb/>The group which has been work
<lb/>ing in the area of Rational Thinking
<lb/>will meet at 2:00 p.m. on November
<lb/>5, at the Board of Education building
<lb/>in Syracuse. Subsequent meetings
<lb/>will be planned at that time.
<lb/>The Leisure time workshop will
<lb/>be conducted from November 17
<lb/>through 21, starting each day at
<lb/>10:00 a.m.
<lb/>It is expected that the results of
<lb/>the study will be ready in published
<lb/>form for school use early in 1953.

<lb/>On Council Aciivities Patterns Of Actions
<lb/>LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
<lb/>RATED SUCCESSFUL
<lb/>Thirty-two participants from 18 Coun
<lb/>cil schools and the Council staff
<lb/>took part in the Leadership Confer
<lb/>ence held September 19-21 at Pine
<lb/>Brook Camp, Upper Saranac Lake.
<lb/>Fifteen members of families of the
<lb/>participants also attended.
<lb/>Two conference sessions were
<lb/>devoted to planning for the work of
<lb/>study committees during the current
<lb/>year. In the other two sessions con
<lb/>sideration was given to the nature
<lb/>of democratic leadership in study
<lb/>groups and some of the problems in
<lb/>volved in this kind of group activity.
<lb/>The conference was called in re
<lb/>sponse to one of the recommendations
<lb/>made at the Imagineering Conference
<lb/>held last May at Pine Brook Camp.
<lb/>At that time it was felt that such
<lb/>a leadership conference held at the
<lb/>beginning of the school year would
<lb/>further develop the understanding
<lb/>and skills of committee leadership
<lb/>and group dynamics on the part of
<lb/>study committee leaders.
<lb/>Halverson Was Consultant
<lb/>Serving as chief consultant for
<lb/>the conference was Dr. Paul M. Hal
<lb/>verson, Associate Professor of Edu
<lb/>cation at Syracuse University. Dr.
<lb/>Halverson joined the faculty at Syr
<lb/>acuse in July of this year after
<lb/>serving two years on the staff of
<lb/>the Horace Mann-Lincoln Institute
<lb/>of School Experimentation, Teachers
<lb/>College, Columbia University. Dr.
<lb/>Halverson had prior experience as
<lb/>Principal of the Battle Creek (Michi
<lb/>gan) Senior High School, Principal
<lb/>of the Battle Creek Junior High
<lb/>School, and principal and teacher in
<lb/>two Minnesota high schools.
<lb/>Committees Represented
<lb/>In attendance at the conference
<lb/>were chairman and members of the
<lb/>planning committees of the Committee
<lb/>on Flexibility, the Committee on
<lb/>Secondary School Curriculum Develop
<lb/>ment, the Committee on Citizenship
<lb/>Education, and the Committee on
<lb/>School Plant Two members of the
<lb/>Council Executive Committee and
<lb/>several members of steering commit
<lb/>tees were also present.
<lb/>Problems Considered
<lb/>The following problems of commit
<lb/>tee operation were identified by the
<lb/>participants at the beginning of the
<lb/>general session on group dynamics:
<lb/>(1) What are the techniques for elim
<lb/>inating the mechanics of meetings?
<lb/>(2) To what extent should a meeting
<lb/>be structured? (3) What percentage
<lb/>of time spent in a series of meetings
<lb/>should be given to planning and
<lb/>evaluation? (4) To what extent does
<lb/>the assignment of a specific job to
<lb/>be done stifle leadership? (5) How
<lb/>should the leader deal with questions
<lb/>that are philosophical or of purely
<lb/>academic interest?
<lb/>(6) How does a group proceed to
<lb/>set up its own goals and purposes?
<lb/>(7) What can be done about the ten
<lb/>dency to go off on a tangent? (8)
<lb/>How can you deal with the problem
<lb/>children decided to do something
<lb/>about thia
<lb/>Each Monday every boy and girl
<lb/>makes a new glass of milk with his
<lb/>name on it. Then each day that the
<lb/>child drinks milk a symbol is added
<lb/>to his glass. At the end of the week
<lb/>the glasses are full of symbols show
<lb/>ing milk during the week.
<lb/>The health center has been made
<lb/>on one of the walls. Miss Grow-Up
<lb/>stands with the glasses of milk be
<lb/>neath her. At one side is a height
<lb/>chart made so that the children's
<lb/>names can be written opposite their
<lb/>height for each of the remaining
<lb/>months of the year to see how much
<lb/>they have grown in height. Above
<lb/>this is the invitation, "Come and
<lb/>see how tall you are. "
<lb/>The children have shown a great
<lb/>deal of interest and enthusiasm for
<lb/>this project with its accompanying
<lb/>learnings in arithmetic (measurement)
<lb/>and reading (contextual clues in
<lb/>signs).
<lb/>PRACTICE IN WORD
<lb/>RECOGNITION
<lb/>Grace Vought, Red Creek
<lb/>I have found it rather difficult to get
<lb/>little children to do extra drill on
<lb/>new or difficult words in reading.
<lb/>But the children like to play this
<lb/>little word practice game.
<lb/>I make cards with the new and
<lb/>difficult words printed on them. The
<lb/>children blind their eyes and I hide
<lb/>the words around the room on window
<lb/>sills, book shelves, and in other
<lb/>places. Six or seven children are
<lb/>then chosen to find the words. As
<lb/>soon as all of the cards are found,
<lb/>these children go to the front of the
<lb/>room and read the words that are on
<lb/>the cards. The children in their
<lb/>seats watch to see that the words
<lb/>are given correctly. Then the cards
<lb/>are hidden again and another group
<lb/>finds them, until all the children
<lb/>have had a turn.
<lb/>This is a rather pleasant way to
<lb/>study new words and all the children
<lb/>get a chance to move about the room
<lb/>for a few minutes.
<lb/>"ALL ABOARD FOR
<lb/>HEALTHLAND"
<lb/>Fl ossie Derr, La Fayefete
<lb/>School, Wotertown
<lb/>The children, after reading several
<lb/>health stories, decided to travel to
<lb/>Healthland by train.
<lb/>Every car in our health train
<lb/>represented a particular health habit
<lb/>that we must cultivate. The engine
<lb/>was called Exercise, We included a
<lb/>cleanliness car, a food car, and a
<lb/>fresh air coach. A Sunshine Station
<lb/>was made from a graham cracker box
<lb/>covered with yellow paper. For the
<lb/>Slumber Tunnel one half of a large
<lb/>oatmeal box was labeled "ten
<lb/>hours." A track made from brown
<lb/>construction paper passed through a
<lb/>small forest called Tooth Brush
<lb/>Forest. The trees were small twigs
<lb/>set in clay. Tiny paper tooth brushes
<lb/>hung on the trees. Health posters
<lb/>werehung to advertise the excursion.
<lb/>As each child constructed a part
<lb/>of the project and took the imaginary
<lb/>journey with us, his understanding
<lb/>of health grew.

<lb/>OUR HOBBY CORNER
<lb/>Mary E. Ernenwein, Washington
<lb/>Avenue School, Onelda
<lb/>The rear of our first grade room is a
<lb/>most interesting and popular place,
<lb/>with its library table, science table,
<lb/>garden, and easel.
<lb/>The children enjoy the responsi
<lb/>bility of caring for the garden, where
<lb/>there is something growing through
<lb/>out the school year. At the present
<lb/>time we have tulip and narcissus
<lb/>bulbs growing surrounded by ivy.
<lb/>The children never seem to lose
<lb/>interest in the science table which
<lb/>contains a variety of stones, shells,
<lb/>nuts, rock formations, goldfish,
<lb/>turtles, a chemical garden, and other
<lb/>interesting objects which are in our
<lb/>environment during the different
<lb/>seasons. The chemical garden (made
<lb/>with a piece of coal and a liquid mix
<lb/>ture of bluing, water, ammonia, and
<lb/>salt - with a few drops of mercuro-
<lb/>chrome added for color) seems to
<lb/>hold the greatest fascination.
<lb/>The donations for the science
<lb/>table are brought in by the children
<lb/>and this leads to varied and informal
<lb/>discussions regarding the procure
<lb/>ment of the articles and other ex
<lb/>periences involved in the search.
<lb/>We then have a reading period in
<lb/>connection with this project which
<lb/>is thorou^ly enjoyed by all.
<lb/>MISS GROW-UP TELLS
<lb/>ABOUT MILK
<lb/>Louise C. Kellogg, Hannibal
<lb/>In our first grade there is a new ad
<lb/>dition. She is "Miss Grow-Up." Miss
<lb/>Grow-Up is a friend made of oak tag
<lb/>covered with attractive print cloth.
<lb/>This young lady has told the boys
<lb/>and girls that milk is much better
<lb/>than coffee for breakfast and she is
<lb/>a daily reminder to them. She came
<lb/>to our room one morning when a
<lb/>child told in news that he had drunk
<lb/>coffee for breakfast. The class was
<lb/>very distrubed. Upon inquiring, they
<lb/>discovered that many of the children
<lb/>had been drinking coffee daily. The

<lb/>of changing personnel? (9) How can
<lb/>you tactfully re-direct a person who
<lb/>is monopolizing a discussion? (10)
<lb/>How can adequate research material
<lb/>be made aval lable to working groups?
<lb/>(11) Howdoyou get maximum par
<lb/>ticipation in a discussion? (12) How
<lb/>can you pre-stimulate new members?
<lb/>(13) How can you get better results
<lb/>from between-meeting assignments?
<lb/>(14) How does a leader cope with a
<lb/>situation which runs counter to his
<lb/>ideas? (15) How does one start a
<lb/>meeting?
<lb/>(16) What can be done about the
<lb/>selection of participants from a school
<lb/>and the nature of their background
<lb/>for work of committees? (17) How
<lb/>does a chairman avoid dominating a
<lb/>group? (18) How can a leader deter
<lb/>mine after discussion when a group
<lb/>is ready to reach a conclusion? (19)
<lb/>How Can you develop better rapport
<lb/>among group members?
<lb/>Tape Recording Used
<lb/>After a discussion of some of
<lb/>these problems. Dr. Halverson pre
<lb/>sented tape recordings of several
<lb/>situations involving small groups
<lb/>in action. These were analyzed for
<lb/>their broader meanings.
<lb/>Halverson Suggests Principles
<lb/>In opening the second general
<lb/>conference session on leadership
<lb/>problems. Dr. Halverson briefly pre
<lb/>sented some considerations about
<lb/>the nature of democratic leadership.
<lb/>"The nature of groups is deter
<lb/>mined by their purposes," he said.
<lb/>"Groups may establish their own
<lb/>purposes, or someone may establish
<lb/>purposes for the group. Within this
<lb/>framework, leadership is the activity
<lb/>of that person who is perceived by
<lb/>the group as providing or controlling
<lb/>the maximum means by which the
<lb/>group can reach its goal. This defi
<lb/>nition controls what the leader is
<lb/>and how he works. "
<lb/>"According to this definition,"
<lb/>Halverson continued, "situational
<lb/>factors help determine who is the
<lb/>leader and when he functions. Any
<lb/>feeling that leadership is a born
<lb/>characteristic would thus make
<lb/>leadership training of little value.
<lb/>This idea, therefore, has to be dis
<lb/>carded. "
<lb/>"But related to these ideas is
<lb/>a problem: should we all have the
<lb/>same concept of leadership? For
<lb/>instance, one general expectation of
<lb/>leaders is that they ought to tell
<lb/>people what to do. But this," Hal
<lb/>verson emphasized, "is not the con
<lb/>cept of leadership in vogue today.
<lb/>Instead we have the concept of shar
<lb/>ed leadership. All group members
<lb/>have a responsibility along with the
<lb/>leader."
<lb/>Halverson suggested certain oth
<lb/>er pertinent leadership problems.
<lb/>What should be done when tensions
<lb/>arise in a group? How does a leader
<lb/>help a group reach a concensus and
<lb/>communicate with the group? How
<lb/>can conflicts be resolved between
<lb/>individual goals and group goals?
<lb/>In conclusion, Halverson stated
<lb/>that the Council leadership problem
<lb/>20 13
<pb n="14" facs="#page-013"/>
<lb/>On Council Activities
<lb/>is to consider face-to-face problems
<lb/>of groups and group leadership. He
<lb/>pointed out, "Freedom in relation to
<lb/>group activity is the philosophical
<lb/>foundation of the above concept of
<lb/>leadership. If group processes deny
<lb/>this freedom and the democracy we
<lb/>profess, then we are faced with a
<lb/>serious conflict. "
<lb/>Group Discusses Problems
<lb/>In the discussion which followed,
<lb/>the group discussed many of these
<lb/>ideas and a number of the problems
<lb/>listed above. A topic which received
<lb/>considerable attention was the or
<lb/>ganization and planning of the con
<lb/>ference itself.
<lb/>Brought out in the discussion
<lb/>was the danger of underestimating
<lb/>the amount of time needed for plan
<lb/>ning and evaluating in group work.
<lb/>Observer Used
<lb/>Dr. Richard C. Lonsdale, Execu
<lb/>tive Secretary, served as observer
<lb/>for both general sessions of the con
<lb/>ference. In his comments he not
<lb/>only analyzed the flow and dynamics
<lb/>of each session, but also demon
<lb/>strated the function and use of a
<lb/>group observer.

<lb/>HAPPY AND HIS SURPRISES
<lb/>Agnes T. Kraft, Seymour
<lb/>Street School
<lb/>In our kindergarten we have a puppet
<lb/>clown called Happy. He is helpful
<lb/>in many ways; and has been es
<lb/>pecially helpful in interesting and
<lb/>encouraging the children to be
<lb/>bankers on each banking day.
<lb/>Happy lives in a yellow cambric
<lb/>bag which hangs in our room. He
<lb/>comes out every morning for a visit
<lb/>with the children. On Monday he is
<lb/>always certain to remind the children
<lb/>that Tuesday is banking day. He
<lb/>often tells them that there will be a
<lb/>surprise in the yellow bag. Some
<lb/>times the surprise is a new book for
<lb/>our library table, a toy auto, or a
<lb/>turtle or fish or a plant for our room.
<lb/>Last week to his surprise, a five
<lb/>year old put his chubby hand into
<lb/>the bag and found an egg timer for
<lb/>our science table. The children look
<lb/>forward to the surprises found in the
<lb/>bag. Our puppet has created much
<lb/>interest and caused much excitement
<lb/>in our room.

<lb/>These publications take the form of
<lb/>bulletins generally designed for
<lb/>teacher, principal, and superintend
<lb/>ent. Each has its own motif, the last
<lb/>three numbers having the titles:
<lb/>"Effective Bulletin Boards," "Tips
<lb/>for Helping Poor Readers to Learn, "
<lb/>and " Tricks of the Trade. "
<lb/>"Effective Bulletin Boards"
<lb/>deals with the reasons for using bul
<lb/>letin boards, what they are used for,
<lb/>and the tools needed to prepare bulle
<lb/>tin boards. It also considers sources
<lb/>of material, pointers for operation,
<lb/>themes for the bulletin board, and
<lb/>styles of arrangement.
<lb/>Reading problems are considered
<lb/>in the last of these three bulletins
<lb/>and this, as the name implies, in the
<lb/>form of pertinent practices for slow
<lb/>readers. Several techniques for mak
<lb/>ing reading more interesting and ex
<lb/>citing are outlined here. This num
<lb/>ber would be effective for general
<lb/>distribution in a secondary school as
<lb/>it is primarily aimed at reading prob
<lb/>lems at this level.
<lb/>"Tricks of the Trade" takes up
<lb/>a collection of many classroom prac
<lb/>tices, generally aimed at overcoming
<lb/>problems and increasing efficiency.
<lb/>Such things as grading of papers,
<lb/>preparation for class, and assign
<lb/>ments and discipline are considered.

<lb/>"A fact to which we will all give
<lb/>lip service, but which we too often
<lb/>seem to disregard in practice, is that
<lb/>if education of a person is to be in
<lb/>accord with his needs, and persons
<lb/>differ, one from the other, then the
<lb/>offering to each person must be dif
<lb/>ferent. A different kind of percep
<lb/>tion of the same stimuli by different
<lb/>persons is another logical expecta
<lb/>tion. Thus the Northern New Hamp
<lb/>shire School Study Council chose
<lb/>individualization of instruction as
<lb/>its first phase of study. Practices
<lb/>for the individualization of instruc
<lb/>tion were solicited from teachers of
<lb/>the member schools."
<lb/>The publication lists practices
<lb/>dealing with individualization of in
<lb/>struction in both the elementary and
<lb/>secondary school levels, The
<lb/>methods in the schools are stated
<lb/>according to the subject matter. Ele
<lb/>mentary school subjects noted are
<lb/>arithmetic, art, language arts, music,
<lb/>social studies, and other useful prac
<lb/>tices. The secondary school courses
<lb/>are business, foreign languages, lang
<lb/>uage arts, science and social studies.
<lb/>An interesting comment in the
<lb/>pamphlet notes that the enthusiasm
<lb/>for these products of council ac
<lb/>tivities grew out of the First Nation
<lb/>al Conference of School Study Coun
<lb/>cils held at Syracuse.

<lb/>On Council Activities
<lb/>CHIEF REPORTERS VOTE
<lb/>CHANGES IN REPORTER
<lb/>At their annual meeting on October
<lb/>23, the member school chief reporters
<lb/>voted a variety of changes in THE
<lb/>REPORTER. Most striking is the
<lb/>new format used for the first time
<lb/>with this issue. Exactly one-half
<lb/>the former size, the smaller publi
<lb/>cation will be easier to read and to
<lb/>carry.
<lb/>Other recommendations made by
<lb/>the chief reporters will be incorpor
<lb/>ated in future issues of THE RE
<lb/>PORTER
<lb/>Meeting for a whole day at Drum-
<lb/>lins, the group spent the morning
<lb/>becoming oriented to the purposes
<lb/>and background of Council journals.
<lb/>They studied the major publications
<lb/>which have been issued by the Coun
<lb/>cil and examined journals published
<lb/>by other school study councils in
<lb/>other parts of the state and nation.

<lb/>ers College, 1952. Pp. 25. $.15.
<lb/>This booklet is a collection of prac
<lb/>tices for the teaching of good citi
<lb/>zenship at all levels in the school.
<lb/>There are practices extending from
<lb/>kindergarten through the primary and
<lb/>intermediate grades into the high
<lb/>school.
<lb/>In cooperation with the Citizen
<lb/>ship Education Project, practices
<lb/>were collected from council schools
<lb/>and were then selected and refined
<lb/>by an editorial committee. The prac
<lb/>tices are divided into three classifi
<lb/>cations: economic practices, politi
<lb/>cal practices and social practices.
<lb/>The form in which these prac
<lb/>tices are recorded makes reading and
<lb/>reference quite simple. The form
<lb/>used is as follows: Title of the prac
<lb/>tice, grade level, values to be de
<lb/>rived, and a description of the prac
<lb/>tice. The practices are mainly sug
<lb/>gestive and may be modified to fit
<lb/>any particular teaching situation.
<lb/>An example of a practice listed
<lb/>is as follows: "Title-Current Events
<lb/>Day. Grade Level: Junior High
<lb/>School. Values: Developing the abil
<lb/>ity to read and organize information
<lb/>about current events. Description:
<lb/>One day a week is set aside for cur
<lb/>rent events. Three class members.
<lb/>what events their class will cover
<lb/>and how the material will be present
<lb/>ed. Two days before the current
<lb/>events period, the students meet with
<lb/>the teacher to go over the plans. The
<lb/>presentation of the material may in
<lb/>clude quizzes, panel discussion, and
<lb/>map work."

<lb/>This publication was developed by
<lb/>the Committee on Public Relations,
<lb/>consisting of elementary and sec
<lb/>ondary school teachers. In it the
<lb/>committee has brought together a
<lb/>large number of practices all dealing
<lb/>with the improvement of public re
<lb/>lations.
<lb/>The committee has broken the
<lb/>subject into four categories: the use
<lb/>of printed materials, radio and tele
<lb/>vision, cooperation with community
<lb/>agencies, and improved person-to-
<lb/>person relationships.
<lb/>In the first category they con
<lb/>sider the use of printed materials as
<lb/>an instrument of improving public re
<lb/>lations. The use of local newspapers
<lb/>is the first possibility and under this
<lb/>we find suggested methods for organ
<lb/>izing to collect and release news.
<lb/>general procedures, and forming the
<lb/>content of news releases. This is
<lb/>followed by a consideration of school
<lb/>newspapers and their use in improved
<lb/>public relations.
<lb/>The preparation and use of pam
<lb/>phlets and brochures are outlined
<lb/>along with suggested topics for this
<lb/>type of publication. Many other types
<lb/>of printed matter are listed and each
<lb/>type is considered. Among these are
<lb/>handbooks for students, parents, and
<lb/>teachers; yearbooks; fliers; letters;
<lb/>and report card "staffers. "
<lb/>"Radio and television offer an
<lb/>excellent method for projecting the
<lb/>school into community homes. The
<lb/>personal appeal of this type of home
<lb/>contact is of tremendous value in
<lb/>that it arouses mutual school-com
<lb/>munity interest." Following this in
<lb/>troduction, the committee reviews the
<lb/>varied types of suitable broadcasts
<lb/>to use, and the procedures for ob
<lb/>taining radio and television time.
<lb/>Also, we find important procedures
<lb/>for program preparation.
<lb/>The last two categories, improv
<lb/>ing public relations through coopera
<lb/>tion with community agencies and
<lb/>through person-to-person relation
<lb/>ships, are as well-developed as the
<lb/>earlier section of this booklet.

<lb/>From Other Councils
<lb/>The approach to the problems of pu
<lb/>pil discipline used in this publica
<lb/>tion is reflected in the letter to par
<lb/>ents found on the third page: "Dear
<lb/>Parents: Is there discipline in our
<lb/>schools today? Some who interpret
<lb/>discipline as the imposition of au
<lb/>thority say NO. Others who regard
<lb/>discipline as punishment for wrong
<lb/>doing also say No. Those who be
<lb/>lieve that control of self can lead to
<lb/>socially acceptable behavior say
<lb/>Yes. This self-discipline is based
<lb/>on the belief that an individual learns
<lb/>self-control when he takes responsi
<lb/>bility for his own behavior and thinks
<lb/>and plans for himself. It is this con
<lb/>cept of discipline which our schools
<lb/>are trying to develop. At the same
<lb/>time, schools recognize there must
<lb/>be a judicious balance between im-
<lb/>positionof authority onthe one hand,
<lb/>and delegation of responsibility to
<lb/>the individual on the other. This
<lb/>booklet explains how our schools
<lb/>help children develop into self-dis
<lb/>ciplined individuals. "
<lb/>Social aspects of child discipline
<lb/>are considered, such as adjustment
<lb/>to school, self-reliance, considera
<lb/>tion for others, and respect for au
<lb/>thority. The booklet concludes with
<lb/>suggestions to parents, outlining
<lb/>their function in the development of
<lb/>proper attitudes in their child.
<lb/>This publication was designed
<lb/>by a committee of classroom teachers
<lb/>for parent education purposes. It con
<lb/>tains an excellent group of pictures.
<lb/>It is easily read and easily under
<lb/>stood.
