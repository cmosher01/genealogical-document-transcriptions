<lb/>FORM IT-2105 (Page 2) NEW YORK STATE
<lb/>DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED INCOME TAX INSTRUCTIONS
<lb/>1965
<lb/>1. PURPOSE OF DECLARATION â The Declaration provides a
<lb/>means of paying your personal income tax on a current basis if you
<lb/>have income from sources other than wages on which tax is withheld.
<lb/>It is also used for paying unincorporated business income tax on a
<lb/>current basis. Declarations of both estimated personal income tax
<lb/>and estimated unincorporated business income tax may be made on
<lb/>one Form IT-2105. Use name and address as shown on your personal
<lb/>income tax return.
<lb/>If you are entitled to a refund because the amount withheld from
<lb/>your wages and/or the amount paid or credited as estimated tax
<lb/>for the taxable year exceeds your actual tax liability, you must file
<lb/>an income tax return to obtain the refund. See instructions for filing
<lb/>personal income tax returns and unincorporated business tax returns
<lb/>for full information including other filing requirements.
<lb/>2. WHO MUST MAKE A DECLARATION â You must file a
<lb/>Declaration if you expect your total New York income (as defined
<lb/>in Instruction 3 below), other than from wages on which New
<lb/>York State income tax is withheld, to exceed $600 multiplied by the
<lb/>number of your exemptions, plus $400.
<lb/>A Declaration must also be filed if you carry on an unincorporated
<lb/>business within New York State and expect your unincorporated
<lb/>business taxable income (Line 11 of Tax (Computation Schedule) to
<lb/>exceed $2,500. Individuals, estates and trusts required to make Decla
<lb/>rations of Estimated Unincorporated Business Tax must use Form
<lb/>IT-2105; partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities must
<lb/>use Form IT-2105-UB.
<lb/>Note: See Instructions 9 and 10 permitting a 1965 personal or unin
<lb/>corporated business income tax return to be filed instead of
<lb/>the Declaration otherwise required.
<lb/>3. HOW TO ESTIMATE YOUR TAX FOR 1965 â The Tax Com
<lb/>putation Schedule on the front of this form will help you estimate your
<lb/>tax for 1965. Use 1964 income tax forms and instructions as a guide.
<lb/>Personal Income Tax â The term "total New York income" (Line
<lb/>1 of Tax Computation Schedule) means New. York Adjusted Gross
<lb/>Income which is Federal Adjusted Gross Income as defined in the
<lb/>Federal Internal Revenue Code, plus or minus the additions and sub
<lb/>tractions described in the instructions for New York resident returns
<lb/>(Forms IT-201-I and IT-201-P) and New York nonresident returns
<lb/>(Forms IT-203-P and IT-203-I). The "total New York income" of a
<lb/>nonresident relates only to items from New York sources. The term
<lb/>"Estimated Tax" (Line 3 of Declaration) as applied to personal
<lb/>income tax is the amount you estimate as your 1965 personal income
<lb/>tax liability less the tax you expect to be withheld throughout the year.
<lb/>Unincorporated Business Income Tax â The term "net income
<lb/>from business" (Line 9 of Tax Computation Schedule) means the
<lb/>amount you estimate to be your 1965 net income from business
<lb/>computed according to the instructions for Line 1, Schedule U-C of
<lb/>1964 Unincorporated Business Tax Return Form IT-202. The term
<lb/>"Estimated Tax" (Line 3 of Declaration) as applied to unincorpo
<lb/>rated business income tax is the amount you estimate as your 1965
<lb/>unincorporated business income tax liability.
<lb/>See Schedule U-C of 1964 Form IT-202 to determine Business Tax
<lb/>Credit to be entered on Line 13 of Tax Computation Schedule.
<lb/>4. PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES â
<lb/>New York Tax Rate Schedule
<lb/>7. FISCAL YEAR TAXPAYERS â If you report income on a fiscal
<lb/>year basis, substitute the corresponding fiscal year months for the
<lb/>months specified in the various Instructions. For example, if your
<lb/>fiscal year begins on April 1, 1965, your Declaration of Estimated
<lb/>Income Tax will be due on July 15, 1965, together with payment of
<lb/>first quarter estimated tax. In this instance, equal installments will
<lb/>be due on or before September 15, 1965; December 15, 1965 and
<lb/>April 15, 1966.
<lb/>8. JOINT. DECLARATION â A husband and wife may file a joint
<lb/>Declaration unless they are separated under a decree of divorce or
<lb/>of separate maintenance, or have different taxable years. If a joint
<lb/>Declaration is made but separate returns are filed for the taxable
<lb/>year, the estimated tax for that year may be treated as the estimated
<lb/>tax of either the husband or the wife, or it may be divided between
<lb/>them as they see fit.
<lb/>9. ESTIMATED TAX OF $40 OR LESSâIf the estimated liability
<lb/>for either personal income tax or unincorporated business income tax
<lb/>is $40 or less, you may file your Declaration with respect to such
<lb/>tax on or before January 15, 1966 instead of April 15, 1965. At that
<lb/>â¢ time, you must pay the entire balance of estimated tax. However,
<lb/>if you file your 1965 tax return on or before February 15, 1966, and
<lb/>pay the total tax with your return at that time, you need not file
<lb/>a 1965 Declaration with respect to an estimated tax liability which
<lb/>is $40 or less.
<lb/>10. FARMERS â If at least two-thirds of your total New York
<lb/>income for personal income tax purposes or your taxable income
<lb/>for unincorporated business tax purposes is from farming you may file
<lb/>the Declaration of such tax on or before January 15, 1966, instead
<lb/>of April 15, 1965. At that time, you must pay the entire balance of.
<lb/>estimated tax. However, if you file your 1965 tax return on or
<lb/>before February 15, 1966, and pay the total tax with your return
<lb/>at that time, you need not file a 1965 Declaration with respect to
<lb/>such estimated tax.
<lb/>11. CHANGES IN INCOME, EXEMPTIONS, ETC. â Even though
<lb/>on April 15, 1965, you do not expect your income to be large enough
<lb/>to require filing a Declaration, a change in income or exemptions
<lb/>(or allocation in the case of a Declaration of Estimated Unincorpo
<lb/>rated Business Income Tax) may require you to file a Declaration
<lb/>later. In this event, the requirements are as follows:
<lb/>If change requiring
<lb/>a Declaration to be
<lb/>filed occurs:
<lb/>Declaration
<lb/>is to be
<lb/>filed by:
<lb/>Amount of
<lb/>Estimated
<lb/>Tax Due

<lb/>Sept. 1, 1965..Jan. 1,1966 Jan. 15, 1966 100% Jan. 15, 1966
<lb/>If the amount stated at line 5 of
<lb/>the Tax Computation Schedule is:
<lb/>Not over $L000
<lb/>Overâ Buf not over â
<lb/>YOUR TAX IS:
<lb/>2% of the amount at line 5
<lb/>of excess over â
<lb/>If you file your 1965 tax return by February 15, 1966, and pay
<lb/>the full balance of tax due, you need not: (a) file an amended
<lb/>Declaration or an original Declaration otherwise due for the first
<lb/>time on January 15, 1966, or (b) pay the last installment of estimated
<lb/>tax otherwise due and payable on January 15, 1966.
<lb/>Note: Filing a Declaration or an amended Declaration, or payment
<lb/>of the last installment on January 15, 1966, or filing a tax
<lb/>return by February 15, 1966, will hot satisfy the filing require
<lb/>ments if you failed to file or pay an estimated tax which was
