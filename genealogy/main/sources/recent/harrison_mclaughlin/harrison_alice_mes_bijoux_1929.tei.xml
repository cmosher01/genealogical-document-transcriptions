<lb/>I shall forget you presently,my dear.

<lb/>I will protest you with my favorite vow.
<lb/>I would indeed that love were longer-live^..

<lb/>My Prayer

<lb/>Lord, let me learn the joy
<lb/>of simple deeds,
<lb/>The kind that fit into a
<lb/>comrade's needs:
<lb/>A handclasp that will lend en
<lb/>couragement,
<lb/>A smile—upon a cheering mis
<lb/>sion sent.
<lb/>Let me not be too husy, nor
<lb/>too blind.
<lb/>To see when others need me
<lb/>to be kind.

<lb/>For all the harvest's garnered yield,

<lb/>That trembled in the sun and rain,
<lb/>That hearkened to the pale dew's tread
<lb/>And, lifting from the earth's dark bed.
<lb/>Attained fulfillment in our bread,—
<lb/>1 thank Thee, Lord!
<lb/>For strength to toil with plow and hoc
<lb/>From dawning till the dark swung low.
<lb/>Blessed with the consciousness of health,
<lb/>That is the ultimate in wealth.
<lb/>And for the kindliness to share
<lb/>The anguish and the black despair
<lb/>My fellowmen are made to bear,—
<lb/>1 thank Thee, Lord I
<lb/>For my dear lass and our wee son,
<lb/>Who greet me, when each day is done.
<lb/>With kisses in the open door.
<lb/>As lamplight floods the cottage floor,
<lb/>Where heaven walks the ways of earth
<lb/>And, deeming Grief of little worth,
<lb/>Love fills my heart with joyous mirth,-

<lb/>T^roud Torsos
<lb/>'By Carl Sandburg
<lb/>^UST before the high time of autumn
<lb/>Comes with the crush of its touch,
<lb/>And the leaves fall, the leaves one by one.
<lb/>The leaves by a full darkening sky fall.
<lb/>The trees look proud, the horscchestnut
<lb/>Stands with a gathered pride, the ivies
<lb/>Are gathered around the stumps.
<lb/>The ivies are woven thick with a green coat
<lb/>Covering the stumps. Yes, the trees
<lb/>Look proud now; it is the hig time.
<lb/>Have they not all had summer?
<lb/>Didn't they all dimmer with faint
<lb/>Lines of green in the spring,
<lb/>A thin green mist as if it might
<lb/>Be air or it might be new green leaves?
<lb/>So, the first weeks of September are on.
<lb/>And each tree stands with a murmur,
<lb/>"I stand here with a count of one more year.
<lb/>One more number, one more ring in my
<lb/>torso."
<lb/>Two weeks, five, six weeks, and the trees
<lb/>Will be standing—stripped, gaunt.
<lb/>The leaves gone, the coat of green gone. . . .
<lb/>And they will be proud, but no longer
<lb/>With the gathered pride of the days
<lb/>In the high time.
