<lb/>Driver caught at scene of 2nd crash
<lb/>Continued from A1 "Pm „I m sad about it
<lb/>Police said the accident re
<lb/>mains under Investigation, and
<lb/>more charges against Lamb are
<lb/>likely.
<lb/>Lamb's bond was set at
<lb/>$100,000, and she was admitted
<lb/>to St. Vincent's Medical Center
<lb/>In Bridgeport after complain
<lb/>ing of injuries, police said.
<lb/>Asked whether intoxication
<lb/>may have been a factor in the
<lb/>accident, police Lt. Gary Mac-
<lb/>Namara said only. "What fac
<lb/>tors played a role in the
<lb/>accident are under investiga
<lb/>tion."
<lb/>Eberhardt was walking on
<lb/>thb side of Stratfield Road,
<lb/>against traffic, when Lamb
<lb/>struck him head-on, police
<lb/>siid.
<lb/>There are no sidewalks
<lb/>along that stretch of Stratfield
<lb/>Road, and Eberhardt was walk
<lb/>ing between the edge of the
<lb/>road and a white line, about 2
<lb/>feet away that runs its length.
<lb/>Police did not fault Eberhardt
<lb/>for walking there.
<lb/>," Rosemary
<lb/>PetroceUi, one of Eberhardt's
<lb/>neighbors, said Tuesday after
<lb/>noon. "He seemed like a very
<lb/>nice man."
<lb/>Eberhardt walked to the Strat
<lb/>field IGA Supermarket and to
<lb/>Owen Fish Park every day ftum
<lb/>his home, where he lived with
<lb/>relatives, PetroceUi said.
<lb/>"If 1 was working outside, he
<lb/>would come over and talk and
<lb/>joke. He liked to walk," Petro
<lb/>ceUi said. "Sometimes I would
<lb/>see him m the supermarket,
<lb/>and I asked him if he wanted a
<lb/>ride, and he said, no, he wanted
<lb/>to walk."
<lb/>George Wensky, another
<lb/>neighbor, said Eberhardt used
<lb/>to offer him rides after Wensky
<lb/>lost the abUity to drive about
<lb/>eight years ago. "1 gave him my
<lb/>CadUlac car. He used to take me
<lb/>everywhere," Wensky said. "He
<lb/>was kind of a loner, but he was
<lb/>a very nice man."
<lb/>Eberhardt lived in the neigh
<lb/>borhood for at least several
<lb/>decades, Wensky said.
<lb/>Lamb was driving a 1991-
<lb/>"It's scary when you
<lb/>think about it. This poor
<lb/>guy got up to take a walk
<lb/>this morning, and now
<lb/>he's dead. It's pretty
<lb/>scary, how quick it
<lb/>happens."
<lb/>— Bob Sorrentino,
<lb/>Bridgeport resident
<lb/>Pontiac north on Stratfield
<lb/>Road about 8:50 a.m. when she
<lb/>aUegedly struck Eberhardt,
<lb/>who was walking south, near
<lb/>LUalyn Drive. Eberhardt was
<lb/>thrown over Lamb's car after
<lb/>striking the hood and wind
<lb/>shield, police said.
<lb/>Lamb faUed to stop after
<lb/>striking Eberhardt, police said.
<lb/>EventuaUy, Lamb turned
<lb/>around and drove south on
<lb/>Stratfield Road, passing Eber
<lb/>hardt, who was lying on the
<lb/>grassy shoulder. She did not
<lb/>stop, but continued to Stratfield
<lb/>Center, where she got into a
<lb/>second accident on Fairfield
<lb/>Woods Road, police said.
<lb/>No one else was injured in
<lb/>the second accident in which
<lb/>Lamb reportedly struck anoth
<lb/>er car.
<lb/>Police officers responding to
<lb/>the scene found Lamb at the
<lb/>scene of the second accident,
<lb/>complaining of injuries. Lamb
<lb/>\yas listed in satisfactory condi
<lb/>tion Tuesday evening in St.
<lb/>Vincent's.
<lb/>Police closed a section of
<lb/>Stratfield Road for several
<lb/>hours while they investigated
<lb/>the scene.
<lb/>Bob Sorrentmo, 55, of
<lb/>Bridgeport, watched the police
<lb/>investigation from Owen Fish
<lb/>Park. "They said it was a hit-
<lb/>and-run," Sorrentino said. "It's
<lb/>scary when you think about it.
<lb/>This poor guy got up to take a
<lb/>walk this morning, and now
<lb/>he's dead. It's pretty scary, how
<lb/>quick it happens."

<lb/>Overcrowding cited for shifting school lines

<lb/>• The changes also have creat
<lb/>ed ripple effects well beyond
<lb/>Central. Blackham, a kinder
<lb/>garten- through-eighth-grade
<lb/>school whose students go on to
<lb/>attend Central, was also over
<lb/>crowded. Steps are being taken
<lb/>to reduce enrollment there by
<lb/>sending students to Roosevelt
<lb/>School in the South End.
<lb/>Because Bassick High wHl
<lb/>need to use more classroom
<lb/>space, the system needs to re
<lb/>duce enrollment at Ellas Howe
<lb/>School, which currently uses
<lb/>some Bassick classrooms.

<lb/>kindergarten-through-eighth-
<lb/>grade school — whose students
<lb/>traditionally go on to Central
<lb/>— wiU instead go to Harding.
<lb/>Huydlc said meetings about
<lb/>redistricting began last winter,
<lb/>and principals sent out letters
<lb/>this spring. Some schools also
<lb/>had meetings for parents In
<lb/>volved, he said.
<lb/>Does that mean there wiU be
<lb/>some confusion, anyway?
<lb/>"No doubt about it," he said.
<lb/>The matter, however, never
<lb/>came up for formal approval
<lb/>before the Board of Educafion,
<lb/>but officials contend that does
<lb/>n't matter.
<lb/>"It's not invalid," said board
<lb/>President Joan K. Nobriga of
<lb/>the redistricting. Nobriga said
<lb/>that in the case of school dis
<lb/>trict modifications in the past,
<lb/>atoinistrators have made ad
<lb/>justments as needed.
<lb/>Stm, she said, she wished
<lb/>the board had had the opportu
<lb/>nity for an open airing of the
<lb/>matter, as it would have provid
<lb/>ed parents with an opportrmity
<lb/>to learn about the changes.
<lb/>"I'd rather deal with the
<lb/>complaints right now," she
<lb/>said, rather than waiting untU
<lb/>the start of the school year or
<lb/>the next full board meeting.
<lb/>Huydic said the fuU impact
<lb/>of redistricting won't be felt for
<lb/>several years.
<lb/>Huydic said parents who
<lb/>stm reaUy want to 'have their
<lb/>chUd attend a school out of dis
<lb/>trict can stm ask for a transfer,
<lb/>but there simply may not be a
<lb/>spot.
<lb/>"We try to accommodate the
<lb/>parents' needs as much as we
<lb/>can," Huydic said. "However,
<lb/>there are times we just can't do
<lb/>that."
