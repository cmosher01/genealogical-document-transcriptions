<head><hi rend="center"><lb/>FelicÃ­simo LÃ³pez</hi></head>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>âFelicÃ­simo LÃ³pez was born in Quito on August 6, 1847, the
<lb/>fourth son of Don Mariano Auz and DoÃ±a Dolores LÃ³pez, both of
<lb/>Quito.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At the
<hi rend="underline">Colegio de los JesuÃ­tas</hi>, he studied Latin under
<lb/>Don Buenaventura ProaÃ±o, and Humanities under Padre HerzÃ¡ez;<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
<lb/>he then entered the Facultad de Medicina in Quito, and received
<lb/>his MD degree in 1872. (I have all his diplomas.). In 1873 he
<lb/>moved to Jipijapa to set up practice:<hi rend="sup">3</hi> two years later he married
<lb/>Francisca Romero and they had nine children, not all of whom were
<lb/>born in Jipijapa, however. In this town, birthplace of the straw
<lb/>hat,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> without giving up his practice, he opened and ran a shop,
<lb/>as do many doctors on the coast, doing retail and wholesale
<lb/>business.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In 1882, news came that General Veintimilla, in viola<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>tion of the Constitution, had declared himself <hi rend="underline">Jefe Supremo de la
<lb/>RepÃºblica</hi>.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> LÃ³pez was so outraged that the same day he enlisted
<lb/>as a âmedicâ with the patriotic forces that were already forming to
<lb/>oust the dictator..... (the political turmoils went on for some time,
<lb/>and a man named Jose MarÃ­a CaamaÃ±o was named Interim President)...
<lb/>when CaamaÃ±o was elected President in 1884, he adopted a policy of
<lb/>terrorism against the insurgents; this obliged LÃ³pez to join the
<lb/>revolutionary forces which were under the command of General Eloy
<lb/>Alfaro, and the decisive defeat suffered at JaramijÃ³ in 1885 forced
<lb/>LÃ³pez, now âSurgeon General of the Revolutionary Forcesâ to flee
<lb/>to Peru.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It wasnât until 1888, when Antonio Flores was elected
<lb/>President, that a general amnesty was declared and LÃ³pez was able
<lb/>to return to Jipijapa and his family...<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
</p>



<pb n="2" facs="#page-006"/>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>...It was then that the Bishop of Portoviejo, Peter Schumacher,
<lb/>began to accuse and denounce LÃ³pez in his sermons and pastoral
<lb/>letters... in 1889 the family moved to Chone, where Dr. LÃ³pez set
<lb/>up a new practice and began to write articles to âEl Horizonteâ
<lb/>and the âDiario de Avisos,â large newspapers in Guayaquil, in which,
<lb/>among other topics, he criticized the actions of this representative
<lb/>of the church. This led to a judicial action against LÃ³pez and his
<lb/>excommunication.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In 1892, he and his family moved to Guayaquil,
<lb/>where he again set up practice and continued his journalistic and
<lb/>political work. In 1894 he was elected Senator for the province of
<lb/>Esmeraldas, but was denied, unconstitutionally, his seat in the
<lb/>Congress because he was an excommunicant.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>âAfter the political transformation of 1895,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> he was named
<lb/>Colector de Rentas Fiscales (roughly tax&#x2010;collector), a position he
<lb/>held until 1900; he was elected Delegate to the 1896 convention
<lb/>for the province of ManabÃ­ (where Jipijapa is), and went to Quito
<lb/>(taking Nana with him, against Mamitaâs strenuous objections, so
<lb/>that she could meet her relatives; the idea came from his brother
<lb/>Francisco, Malvinaâs father. It was on this trip that Nana met Papa.)
<lb/>At the beginning of 1900, Alfaro, now President, named LÃ³pez Consul
<lb/>General in New York.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> In October of the same year, he was named
<lb/>Minister Plenipotenciary before the government of Venezuela, and
<lb/>was given an honorary decoration by that country (CondecoraciÃ³n de
<lb/>Segunda Clase del Busto del Libertador). He was later sent in the
<lb/>same capacity to Nicaragua, and subsequently recalled to Ecuador as
<lb/>first Minister of Education and later, of the Interior, which latter
<lb/>position he resigned in August of 1901, returning to New York.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
</p>



<pb n="3" facs="#page-007"/>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>In March of 1906 he was again named Consul in New York, which
<lb/>position he held until in 1911 he was summoned by Alfaro to Quito
<lb/>to be Minister of the Interior again..... he was there for the 1911
<lb/>revolution.... After January 28, 1912 (when the clergy and the
<lb/>Conservatives staged a bloody coup in which Alfaro and other
<lb/>Liberal political figures were massacred) Dr, LÃ³pezâs life was in
<lb/>danger, and when it was safe for him to leave his hiding place,
<lb/>he left Ecuador permanently and settled in New York, where he
<lb/>died on December 15, 1917. He is buried in Evergreens Cemetery,
<lb/>Brooklyn.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> There are other data: he was thrice a member of the
<lb/>City Council of Jipijapa; a member of the board of the
<lb/>Quito&#x2010;Guayaquil Railway; Ecuadorean <hi rend="underline">Charge dâAffaires</hi> in Washington;
<lb/>a delegate to the International Conference on Industrial Property
<lb/>Protection held in Washington in May, 1911; and finally, a member
<lb/>of the Venezuelan Academy of History. In 1901 and 1910 he declined
<lb/>his nomination as candidate for the office of President of Ecuador.â
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>(He wrote a number of books and pamphlets, articles, etc.,
<lb/>of which the most important are: the first complete Atlas of
<lb/>Ecuador, published under his supervision while he was Minister
<lb/>of Education; <hi rend="underline">Historia de una excomuniÃ³n en el Ecuador</hi>, New York,
<lb/>1909, and <hi rend="underline">Virutas</hi>, New York, 1908. <hi rend="underline">Virutas</hi> means wood shavings, or
<lb/>chips; for Xmas 1905, LÃ³pez received from his son Miguel Angel a

<head><hi rend="center"><lb/>FelicÃ­simo LÃ³pez &#x2010; Notes</hi></head>
<p>
<lb/>1) &#x2010; This biographical sketch was extracted (translated and edited
<lb/>by me) from âPersonalidades Ilustres de la Medicina Nacionalâ by
<lb/>Luis A. LeÃ³n, an article which appeared in 1951 in <hi rend="underline">Papeles MÃ©dicos</hi>,
<lb/>the organ of the local (Quito) equivalent of the A.M.A. It was just
<lb/>one of the many times over the years that someone has taken an
<lb/>interest in FelicÃ­simo LÃ³pezâs life and has written on some aspect
<lb/>of it. There is a town called Puerto LÃ³pez somewhere on the coast
<lb/>of Ecuador, and in the early 60âs, EloÃ­sa, who was then living in
<lb/>Quito, was present as Guest of Honor, as LÃ³pezâs only surviving
<lb/>child, at a gala in his honor at the Quito Press Clubâs Hall of
<lb/>Fame, for which she supplied some material. Professor Justino
<lb/>Cornejo of the Facultad de Historia de la Universidad de Guayaquil
<lb/>did a monograph on LÃ³pez around the same time. The list goes on, and
<lb/>will probably continue to do so, since LÃ³pezâs excommunication and
<lb/>subsequent expulsion from the Ecuadorean Senate made quite a <hi rend="underline">cause
<lb/>cÃ©lÃ¨bre</hi>; he is something of a hero in the history of civil rights in
<lb/>Ecuador. Since illegitimacy is not a particularly heroic condition,
<lb/>when EloÃ­sa was approached for biographical data for this article,
<lb/>as well as all the others, most probably, she gave as FelicÃ­simoâs
<lb/>fatherâs last name LÃ³pez. As a perusal of the charts that preceded
<lb/>these ramblings will show, his name should have been given as
<lb/>Mariano <hi rend="underline">Auz</hi>.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>This worthy was a priest in the monastery&#x2010;church of La Merced.
<lb/>He was famed a very learned man (the earliest family member who is
<lb/>recalled as possessing this very family trait) but extremely con<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>servative and pious. Piety among clerics in Ecuador then, as else<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>where and at other times, was a rather relative thing, and many



<pb n="5" facs="#page-009"/>
<lb/>priests had children; some openly maintained homes, or some sort of
<lb/>family establishments. (Curiously enough, the same didnât apply to
<lb/>nuns; if they violated their vows, they were discreet about it.)
<lb/>One of Nanaâs neighbors in Jipijapa, when she was a little girl,
<lb/>was a priest named Ontaneda and his family. Mariano Auz, <hi rend="underline">Father</hi>
<lb/>Mariano Auz, had by Dolores LÃ³pez five sons (chart 5); there was
<lb/>also a much older half sister, on whose side I donât know, named
<lb/>Rosario Daste, though the last name Daste, rather than LÃ³pez, would suggest
<lb/>that Father Auz had known other ladies previously, since <hi rend="underline">hijos
<lb/>naturales</hi>, especially when they were also <hi rend="underline">hijos sacrÃ­legos</hi>, were
<lb/>almost always given their motherâs last name. All five brothers
<lb/>loved Rosario Daste, who was like a second mother (I know nothing at
<lb/>all about Dolores LÃ³pez, when she died, how, etc.) and who was
<lb/>lamentably killed by a stray bullet in some remote political skirmish
<lb/>in Quito. The family lived in la Casa del Cebollar, named after the
<lb/>hilly street on which it stood, and which once ended in a large
<lb/>field planted with onions. It was still standing in 1959, when I
<lb/>saw it and took a couple of pictures of its thick walls, but it was
<lb/>no longer owned or lived in by anyone related, and the neighborhood
<lb/>was in the most obvious state of irreversible decline.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>The piety and intelligence of Mariano Auz were, according to
<lb/>Nana, unfortunatley accompanied and surpassed by an inhuman paternal
<lb/>severity which can only be described as sadistic. FelicÃ­simo told of
<lb/>a room in this house, completely empty save for a large stake firmly
<lb/>embedded in the middle of the floor. The slightest real or imagined
<lb/>infraction by any of the five sons was instantly punishable by being
<lb/>tied to this post and thrashed. (One wonders whether Rosario Daste
<lb/>ever got the treatment as well.) Auz was a Dominican, and the picture



<pb n="6" facs="#page-010"/>
<lb/>I have of him, and will hopefully be able to locate, shows a face
<lb/>one would not relish meeting in a dark alley. Miraculously, the
<lb/>boys survived all this and came out of it with an eduring distaste
<lb/>for any sort of paternal physical abuse and a great appreciation
<lb/>of the duties and responsibilities of parenthood vis&#x2010;Ã &#x2010;vis the
<lb/>love of oneâs children.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>2) &#x2010; Both ProaÃ±o and HernÃ¡ez were renowned educators of the time.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>3) &#x2010; Quito was full of doctors, and FelicÃ­simoâs brother Carlos
<lb/>wrote from the coast and suggested that the privince of ManabÃ­,
<lb/>rural and still backward, needed doctors.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>4) &#x2010; âPanamaâ hats are really made in Jipijapa. They became very
<lb/>fashionable here after the Panama Canal opened up new avenues of
<lb/>trade. I donât think Ethel Merman would have signed a contract to
<lb/>sing in a musical called âJipijapa Hattie.â
</p>

<p>
<lb/>5) &#x2010; Jipijapa (Hee&#x2010;pee&#x2010;hah&#x02C8;&#x2010;pah) is a town, and a small one at that,
<lb/>but itâs situated at a main crossroads point... the road is still too
<lb/>primitive to merit the term highway junction. FelicÃ­simo ran a sort
<lb/>of general store to make ends meet in this semi&#x2010;arid tropical
<lb/>backwater.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>6) &#x2010; Sounds familiar. <hi rend="underline">Jefe Supremo</hi> was one of the official titles
<lb/>of the president, though not necessarily indicative always of an
<lb/>electoral victory. I think Franco was styled <hi rend="underline">Jefe Supremo del Estado
<lb/>EspaÃ±ol Generalissimo</hi> Francisco Franco, etc.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>7) &#x2010; He was there three years, and was friendly with the intellectual
<lb/>circle of Liman society and Peru in general, among whom Ricardo
<lb/>Palma, famous Peruvian short story writer, Ã  la Mark Twain. He also
<lb/>managed during this time to father a son by some <hi rend="underline">tapada</hi>; he brought
<lb/>the boy back with him in 1888. Mamita, who had always taken a dim
<lb/>view of Abuelitoâs political heroism (or heroics, if you please),



<pb n="7" facs="#page-011"/>
<lb/>took even greater umbrage at having to raise this unanticipated
<lb/>addtion to her own brood. His name was Carlos, and was described
<lb/>to me by Malvina, (through whom I first heard of his existence) as being
<lb/>very dark, but the image of FelicÃ­simo. He never really felt com<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>fortable with Mamita, though the children liked him (why not, after
<lb/>all?) and called him <hi rend="underline">Ã±aÃ±Ã³</hi>, roughly, âlittle brother,â affectionately.
<lb/>When the family moved to Guayaquil, he moved out on his own, dropped
<lb/>out of sight, and I suppose got married and had a nice life. I shall
<lb/>always find it curious that neither Nana nor EloÃ­sa ever mentioned
<lb/>him to me, since they never scrupled to tell me about similar cases
<lb/>among their uncles, and about Auz. I suppose, if the story is true,
<lb/>and why would Malvina invent such a whopper, if such it is, that
<lb/>Nana felt it might tarnish the idealistic image of FelicÃ­simo she
<lb/>was handing down. Personally, I find it reassuring to think that the
<lb/>idealist was also human. At any rate, as the Italians say, <hi rend="underline">si non
<lb/>Ã¨ vero, Ã¨ ben trovato</hi>... if it isnât true, it makes a good story.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>8) &#x2010; But, in 1887 a disasterous fire had devistated the town; there
<lb/>were three victims: an old maid and her neice, and Rosario Romero,
<lb/>Nanaâs grandmother. More on this incident elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>9) &#x2010; This needs a footnote. Abuelito was a <hi rend="underline">feuilletiste</hi> in true
<lb/>19th century style. In places where not too much happens, newspapers
<lb/>carried more features, articles, essays, reviews, etc. This was in
<lb/>the days before advertising covered 80% of a newspaperâs space.
<lb/>Communications then were bad, and intellectuals exchanged their
<lb/>opinions and ideas in essays which were frequently cast in an
<lb/>epistolary form to the Editor, or in the form of a dialogue. In
<lb/>one such exchange, Abuelito signed with the pseudonym âZisca,â and
<lb/>a friend of his always used âAthos.â Some of these were long Letters



<pb n="8" facs="#page-012"/>
<lb/>to the Editors expressing political opinions. If the powers that
<lb/>be disagree with whatever one is saying, they call it propaganda.
<lb/>Ecuador was almost a theocracy at this time; all civil records were
<lb/>kept by the church, which was also the only tolerated religion;
<lb/>ecclesiastics sat in the National Assembly, and there was no lay
<lb/>education; all schooling, such as is was for the masses, was under
<lb/>the control of the church. It was all very corrupt and oppressive, and
<lb/>people could be sent to prison for anitclericalism, which was
<lb/>judicially punishable as heresy. (Did you know, for example, that
<lb/>as late as 1875 a village priest in Peru burnt an old woman as a
<lb/>witch? Admittedly, an extreme example, but it gives an idea of
<lb/>the times.) In some of his articles, LÃ³pez criticized Bishop
<lb/>Schumacher for several abuses, among which the most resented was
<lb/>his prohibition to the local peasants against holding market on
<lb/>Sunday. Schumacher was German, one of many foreign clerics the
<lb/>Curia imported to fill higher ecclesiastical positions; most of
<lb/>these clerics were ignorant of locally senctioned customs.
<lb/>Schumacherâs idea of the Sabbath was more Baptist than Catholic
<lb/>(or more Methodist, or Calvinist, whatever... i.e., the seventh
<lb/>day all you do is go to church.) and failed to take into account
<lb/>that his abrogation of the customary Market&#x2010;on&#x2010;sunday&#x2010;in&#x2010;the&#x2010;plaza
<lb/>tradition imposed great hardship on the peasants, who now lost a
<lb/>dayâs work, and under pain of mortal sin, let it be added. When
<lb/>Schumacher, in the same newspapers and from his pulpit, cited
<lb/>passages of Scripture to validate his position, LÃ³pez, who had
<lb/>after all studied with the Jesuits, was able to reciprocate in
<lb/>kind and totally refute the bishopâs point. Wonderful book, the
<lb/>Bible; one can make it say exactly what one wishes. At any rate,
<lb/>this went on for a while, until LÃ³pez made the fatal tactical



<pb n="9" facs="#page-013"/>
<lb/>error of referring to the church as a âChristian sect,â which is,
<lb/>after all, what it is. But in those days is was the Holy, Roman
<lb/>and Apostolic Church, officially so, and Schumacher jumped at the
<lb/>opportunity of ridding himself of another âliberal MasÃ³nâ via a
<lb/>Bull of Excommunication, so aptly termed. He declared
<lb/>LÃ³pez an excommunicant âvitandus,â which means that not only is he
<lb/>deprived of the sacraments and Godâs love and all that, but all
<lb/>faithful who deal with him incur mortal sin. LÃ³pez was a doctor
<lb/>amidst superstitious rednecks; it ruined his practice.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>But not everybody was peasants, and popular opinion was
<lb/>strongly behind LÃ³pez. A group of Liberals in Portoviejo, capital
<lb/>of ManabÃ­, spread printed copies of Schumacherâs Bull on the ground
<lb/>between the church and the rectory one rainy day so that he would
<lb/>have to grind his words into the mud as he went to say Mass.
<lb/>There was, however, a lot of rednecks, and LÃ³pezâs life was,
<lb/>strictly speaking, in danger.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>10) &#x2010; LÃ³pez left the extremely documented and complete account of it
<lb/>in his <hi rend="underline">Historia</hi>, which was published in Spanish, and copies of which
<lb/>are in the New York Public Library and the Library of Congress.
<lb/>Having frittered away a number of years in my youth in studying
<lb/>Hispanic literatures, I feel qualified to venture an opinion.
<lb/>He has very fine style; in the <hi rend="underline">pensÃ©es</hi>, (<hi rend="underline">Virutas</hi>), he tells anecdotes
<lb/>that I heard from another first hand source, Nana, so Iâm familiar
<lb/>with the details and can concentrate on the presentation. Very
<lb/>nicely done, warmth, taste. In the political writings, the rhetoric
<lb/>is very nicely constructed, and one gets the impression of great
<lb/>honesty. Too bad he never did fiction per se, or wrote on inter<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>national rather than just local affairs, of limited transcendence.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>11) &#x2010; After a political scandal Ã  la Watergate involving the sale
<lb/>of the use of the national flag for a ship of the navy of a country
<lb/>then at war with someone else, there was a revolution and the
<lb/>Liberals were swept into power by popular election. The new
<lb/>President was Eloy Alfaro, for whom EloÃ­sa was named, and who was
<lb/>Victorâs godfather. It began an enormous social revolution, but
<lb/>not a bloody one; a good comparison, up to today at least, might
<lb/>be Spain after the death of Franco. Sweeping reforms at all levels
<lb/>were implemented.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>12) &#x2010; LÃ³pez wanted his younger sons (Miguel Angel, Aquiles and
<lb/>Samuel) to be educated in the U.S., a country whose estensible
<lb/>political and intellectual freedoms he greatly admired. He asked
<lb/>for the job, and got it. It was a sinecure; his ministerial and
<lb/>diplomatic activities were more important. He, Nana, Papa, Victor
<lb/>(aged 8 months) left Guayaquil on February 1, 1900 and arrived in
<lb/>New York on the 14th. In those pre&#x2010;Canal days, one sailed to the
<lb/>west coast of Panama, took a train across, and boarded another
<lb/>ship on the Atlantic coast. They arrived at night, and in those
<lb/>happier and more trusing days, foreign diplomats had courtesy of
<lb/>the port, and one just gave the number of oneâs entourage, perhaps
<lb/>the names, somebody wrote it down, and thatâs that. Nana used to
<lb/>say that there was no record of her being in this country until
<lb/>FDR days and the Alien Registration Bill. They never became citizens,
<lb/>Nana and Papa; about Papa, I donât know, but Iâm sure it was
<lb/>like Nana. She was proud right down to her last day of her still
<lb/>valid Ecuadorean citizenship. She never wanted to come here,
<lb/>never liked the idea, and used to bemoan her abject decline,
<lb/>which would have been impossible in Ecuador. She was right, too.

<lb/>The party spent that first night at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
<lb/>the Waldorf of its day, at 23rd Street. Abuelito and Papa want to
<lb/>the Metropolitan Opera to see <hi rend="underline">Carmen</hi>, with CalvÃ©, I believe, and
<lb/>Nana was left to the baby and the whoosh&#x2010;whoosh of the ladiesâ long
<lb/>skirts in the hallway. The rest of the family, including Mamita and
<lb/>Malvina, sister&#x2010;cousin Malvina (Dolores), see chart 5, came a year
<lb/>later, Malvina to enter that Fall the Moravian Seminary in Bethlehem,
<lb/>Pennsylvania, a normal school. Aquiles was 13, Miguel 15, and Sam 8.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>13) &#x2010; In his absence, Papa was Acting Consul. It was a comfortable
<lb/>situation, and to the advantage of the Ecuadorean government, because
<lb/>they were both good, efficient civil servants, and they were honest.
<lb/>Itâs too bad they were, in a way, because a Consul can get graft if he
<lb/>wants, and thereâs always someone who wants to give you money in
<lb/>return for some favor. They never got anything off the top, as it were,
<lb/>because there was nothing left when the revolution curtailed their
<lb/>regular salary, and that was the beginning of the end. Neither of
<lb/>these two gentlemen was equipped to handle any other kind of job.
<lb/>Victor was 13 (1912), Miguel was back in Ecuador, Aquiles I think
<lb/>in Argnetina, and Sam was 21. And later that year Amalia, Papaâs
<lb/>mother, died, requiring his immediate return and protracted stay.
<lb/>Insult to injury: EloÃ­sa had a boy friend, American Protestant
<lb/>type doctor. EloÃ­sa was very beautiful as a young woman
<lb/>and retained it into her eighties and death. But when the good young
<lb/>doctor learned that LÃ³pez was no longer a real&#x2010;live furriner diplomat,
<lb/>he stopped calling. The cad.

<p>
<lb/>The running quotes at the end of this section I translated
<lb/>and heavily edited from: <hi rend="underline">OrÃ­genes del Ecuador de hoy: GarcÃ­a
<lb/>Moreno</hi> by Luis Robalino&#x2010;DÃ¡vila; Quito, Talleres GrÃ¡ficos
<lb/>Nacionales, 1948, pp. 3&#x2013;12. This is a biography of Gabriel
<lb/>GarcÃ­a Moreno, who was a President of Ecuador in the 19th century.
<lb/>An extremely able administrator, and probably honest, he was
<lb/>ruthless in his attacks on his opponents, and his politics
<lb/>were somewhat to the right of Ivan the Terrible. He was also
<lb/>a religious fanatic, and during one administration changed the
<lb/>name of the country to the Republic of the Sacred Heart of Jesus
<lb/>and gave it as a fief to the current Pope. It was he who was
<lb/>largely responsible for the importation of foreign clerics
<lb/>mentioned earlier. He was finally assassinated in 1875 on the
<lb/>steps of the Palacio de Gobierno in Quito, to the great relief
<lb/>of many. All this is germaine only because he was alos Mamitaâs
<lb/>uncle.
</p>

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>The GarcÃ­a Morenos were of the âaristocracyâ of Guayaquil,
<lb/>very rich, very conservative, and very Catholic. Juana Mercedes
<lb/>Moreno MorÃ¡n de GarcÃ­a GÃ³mez (chart 4) was carried every day to
<lb/>Mass, in her very old age, on a sedan chair by four servants,
<lb/>and Manuel Ignacio, Gabrielâs brother, was a preist. Sent to a
<lb/>parish in remote Jipijapa, he took along one of the family servants,
<lb/>a girl named Rosario Romero (Mamitaâs mother), and before you
<lb/>knew it, they had five children: Pedro AlcÃ¡ntara, Ignacio, TomÃ¡s,
<lb/>Francisca and Mercedes. At some point, he left for another see
<lb/>and Rosario and the children stayed. Again, per custom, the latter



<pb n="13" facs="#page-017"/>
<lb/>took their motherâs last name. Pedro AlcÃ¡ntara had a homonymous
<lb/>son who died at age 17 in a revolution; TomÃ¡s married and lived in
<lb/>Guayaquil; Ignacio went to Guayaquil too, and was supposed to
<lb/>come visit the family in Brooklyn around 1908, but vanished
<lb/>without a trace after sending a cable saying that he had arrived
<lb/>in Panama; and Mercedes had two daughters by as many men and died
<lb/>in Guayaquil during an epidemic of bubonic plague in 1913. One
<lb/>of these daughters was Rosario GonzÃ¡lez (she did take her real
<lb/>fatherâs name, as did her half sister Rita Alencastro), who in
<lb/>similar fashion had a daughter named Delia Maruri. Nana and Lola
<lb/>kept in touch with Rosario until her death from cancer in 1960 or
<lb/>so. Delia married a man named Eduardo Rossi Guerra, they had a few
<lb/>children, some now married; they live in Guayaquil and are very
<lb/>nice middle class people.
</p>

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Though married to an ardent âfree&#x2010;thinker,â Francisca (Mamita)
<lb/>retained her Catholicism more or less active, until her death at
<lb/>90 of natural causes. She was an intelligent but not an educated
<lb/>nor enlightened lady; nor was she a lady with whom one might deal
<lb/>flippantly. When someone affectionately called her Mama, she would
<lb/>say something to the effect of, âDonât call me mama; Iâm not your
<lb/>mother.â Later, when she had warmed to the person, the greeting was
<lb/>âHello, my son.â She never saw a movie, for superstitious reasons.
<lb/>All in all, she didnât have such an easy time of it; first there
<lb/>were FelicÃ­simoâs idealistic peradventures, which left his wife
<lb/>and children in desperate straits; then there was the revolution
<lb/>in 1912 and all that meant; all her five sons died before she did
<lb/>and she had money worries all her life. The picture shows her at
<lb/>age 51; she was thought to be a great beauty in her youth, because



<pb n="14" facs="#page-018"/>
<lb/>of her fine delicate features, which were her GarcÃ­a Moreno legacy.
<lb/>She looked very much like her dictator uncle, whom she probably
<lb/>never met. Her father probably left home (rectory) when she was
<lb/>very little.
</p>

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Franciscaâs mother, Rosario Romero, lived with her daughter
<lb/>and son&#x2010;in&#x2010;law in Jipijapa. She took care of the children while
<lb/>Mamitaâs time was taken up with running the store during Abuelitoâs
<lb/>exile, (1885&#x2013;88). In 1887, when Nana was ten, some kids were
<lb/>playing with matches, and the better part of the town, which was
<lb/>all cane and straw, went up in smoke. So did three ladies: an old
<lb/>maid and her niece, and Rosario Romero. Nana recalled the
<lb/>catastrophe vividly all her life. As the flames inexhorably approached,
<lb/>Mamita and Rosario Tomero were trying to save as much as possible
<lb/>from the store. Mamita went to find a wagon and Rosario took the
<lb/>children to a surrounding hilltop and told Nana to make sure none
<lb/>of them moved from the spot until her return; she was going to
<lb/>find Mamita. When Rosario returned, she was naked save for a petticoat
<lb/>someone had given her, and burnt all over. Nana said Rosario
<lb/>said nothing until she saw Mamita and told Nana to call out. When
<lb/>Mamita saw Rosario, she called for help, but since Abuelito, the
<lb/>only doctor, wasnât there, all that could be done for the poor
<lb/>woman was to apply linseed oil with cotton to her burns. She died
<lb/>in agony that night. The story goes that when she returned to the
<lb/>store, she saw that the familyâs goat was still tothered and
<lb/>desperately trying to free itself, since the thatch roof of the
<lb/>stable was ablaze. Taking pity on the animal, she went over to
<lb/>untie it and the roof caved in on her. When they managed to pull
<lb/>her out, all her clothes had been burned away.

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>There are some interesting details about Rosario Romero:
<lb/>She was _mestiza_, like just about everyone else in town, but was
<lb/>very dark, and clearly of a different ethnic mixture than anything
<lb/>common in the region. Also, according to Nana, she spoke Spanish
<lb/>with a slight accent. Guayaquil was an important seaport (despite
<lb/>its inland position on an estuary), so Rosario could have come
<lb/>from just about anywhere Spanish or Portuguese were spoken.

<lb/>Now for the quotes from Robalinoâs book. Please bear in

<lb/>âMiserable Castille, one powerful... Castille of grey rocks...
<lb/>dusty Castille covered with saffron plants.... this was the native
<lb/>land of Don Gabriel GarcÃ­a GÃ³mez... Villaverde del Monte is three
<lb/>leagues from Soria... a poor village of 53 souls (1948), though
<lb/>the entire parish has 250... a poor place, but in a land of epics
<lb/>(this is, after all, the land of Don Quixote).. here was born
<lb/>Don Gabriel GarcÃ­a GÃ³mez October 2, 1766, who was baptized the
<lb/>13th. He was the legal son of Don Diego GarcÃ­a Yanguas and DoÃ±a
<lb/>MarÃ­a GÃ³mez, natives and residents of Villaverde. His paternal
<lb/>grandparents were Don Juan GarcÃ­a Yanguas (I think thereâs another
<lb/>shady parentage here... these two men shouldnât have had the same
<lb/>maternal last name Yanguas, but...) and DoÃ±a Josefa MartÃ­nez.
<lb/>This lady was born March 27, 1652, the daughter of Don Alonso
<lb/>MartÃ­nez and DoÃ±a Catalina Escribano, baptized âprivatelyâ that
<lb/>same day âbecause of necessityâ (No idea what that means.); her
<lb/>godmother was her grandmother DoÃ±a Ana de la Orden, âdue to the
<lb/>lack of a godfatherâ (that sounds clear enough). Don Gabriel



<pb n="61" facs="#page-020"/>
<lb/>GarcÃ­a GÃ³mezâs maternal grandparents were Don Juan GÃ³mez and DoÃ±a Cecilia de la Orden,
<lb/>which shows that his parents were interrelated. His godfather
<lb/>was his maternal grandfather Don Juan GÃ³mez, and the certificate
<lb/>was signed by Father Manual GarcÃ­a AragonÃ©s (probably another
<lb/>relative).... His parents were married [hooray] by Father Joseph
<lb/>Cueto, priest of Cidones, November 22, 1762... there were in all
<lb/>probability more younger siblings... one came to Mexico and was the
<lb/>founder of the family that eventually produced the famous historian
<lb/>GarcÃ­a Icazbalceta.... The origins of these families are very old....
<lb/>They were, probably, poor <hi rend="underline">hidalgos</hi> who had just enough land to
<lb/>keep them fed.... He studied in CÃ¡diz at the home of his uncles
<lb/>Don Juan SimÃ³n and Don Melchor MartÃ­nez de Aparicio, who had some
<lb/>commercial enterprises in that port city of Spain. The MartÃ­nez de
<lb/>Aparicio traced their family back five generations; they were
<lb/>Lords of the House of San BartolomÃ© del Cerro in Sotillo (Soria)
<lb/>and proved their nobility before the Tribunal of the Royal
<lb/>Chancellory of Granada and were granted a Royal Provision on March
<lb/>22, 1776. They requested and were granted by Don RamÃ³n Zazo y Ortega
<lb/>a charter with their coat of arms on August 27, 1778... (he then
<lb/>goes on with some lengthy details about these MartÃ­nez, which donât
<lb/>really concern us here.) And one fine day in 1793 while Spain
<lb/>and all Europe were shuddering with fear at the news which kept
<lb/>coming from France (the French Revolution, Napoleon, etc.); urged
<lb/>on by the fear that the Terror would cross the Pyrenees, and helped
<lb/>financially by his uncles in CÃ¡diz, he bought goods for trading
<lb/>and boarded âNuestra SeÃ±ora de las Nieves,â a frigate which was
<lb/>leaving for the colonies... a Spaniard newly arrived from Spain
<lb/>was in those times superior to the creole, contaminated now by



<pb n="17" facs="#page-021"/>
<lb/>by the tropical laziness of the climate (Guayaquil is not what
<lb/>one might term a tropical paradise) and perhaps even by some
<lb/>shadowy <hi rend="underline">mestizaje</hi> of his ancestors. The creoles who had not
<lb/>intermarried preferred, naturally enough, native Spaniards for
<lb/>their daughters... add this fact to Gabriel BarcÃ­a GÃ³mezâs
<lb/>natural good looks, industry, references and ambition, and it is
<lb/>not hard to understand why the <hi rend="underline">Regidor Perpetuo del Cabildo de
<lb/>Guayaquil</hi> (the local potentate), Don Manuel Ignacio Moreno y
<lb/>Sylva Santistevan, and his wife, DoÃ±a Manuela MorÃ¡n de ButrÃ³n
<lb/>y del Castillo should heartily approve of the interest the
<lb/>young man took in their daughter, Juana Mercedes.... The <hi rend="underline">Regidor
<lb/>de Guayaquil</hi> was the son of Don JosÃ© Ignacio Moreno and DoÃ±a
<lb/>Ana Manuela de Sylva Santistevan y Larralde, whose good lineage
<lb/>is evidenced by his permanent position as <hi rend="underline">Regidor</hi>... (there
<lb/>follow some more lengthy details about these good people)... Juana
<lb/>Mercedes was born in Guayaquil in 1780 and married Gabriel GarcÃ­a
<lb/>GÃ³mez in 1797; they had twelve children. The eldest, Josefa
<lb/>Dominga, born in 1798, died at 47; ConcepciÃ³n, at an early age;
<lb/>Manuel Ignacio followed the ecclesiastical career (This was
<lb/>Mamitaâs father); Mercedes, dead at 18; JosÃ©, died young; the
<lb/>second JosÃ© studied Catholic liturgy, but later married MarÃ­a
<lb/>de los Angeles Mateus y VÃ¡smezon (not a Spanish name) and lived
<lb/>to be 71; Carmen, no data; Miguel, one&#x2010;time Governor of Guayaquil;
<lb/>Pedro Pablo, landed gentleman and businessman; Fernando, no data;
<lb/>Rosario, likewise. The youngest was Gabriel GarcÃ­a Moreno.â
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>As the last of all these details, it should be mentioned
<lb/>that DoÃ±a Juana Mercedes, of sedan chair fame, lived to be 91



<pb n="18" facs="#page-022"/>
<lb/>and was all her life a âTory;â after Ecuador gained its independence
<lb/>from Spain in 1822, she continued to hang the Spanish Royal
<lb/>Flag on her door every Independence Day (August 10) until her
<lb/>death. Like Mamita, her granddaughter, she was longlived and
<lb/>feisty.

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>(N.B. Last year Enid and her husband Aurelio came to San
<lb/>Francisco and I met with them; we took a sightseeing bus around
<lb/>town, despite the unfortunate rain and fog. At one point Enid
<lb/>buttonholed me and said that Aurelio, who among other things has
<lb/>been a history teacher, and a Spanish Literature teacher at some
<lb/>midwestern college here, thought Garcia Moreno was the worst thing
<lb/>that ever happened to Ecuador, and would I please not blab any
<lb/>of these scandalous genealogical details to him. I agreed.)

<head><hi rend="center"><lb/>LÃ³pez Romero Family</hi></head>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Having some time ago set down numerous details of some of
<lb/>our progenitors, I should now show you their children. The
<lb/>preceding picture was taken in Brooklyn in 1911, the last year that
<lb/>all surviving family members were together. At some point Iâll
<lb/>sort things out and send pictures of the two missing brothers,
<lb/>(Iâve found them and include them herewith)
<lb/>but for the time being, this <hi rend="underline">prÃ©cis</hi>: to the left of FelicÃ­simo
<lb/>is EloÃ­sa (see charts for dates, etc.), who never married and died
<lb/>childless. Standing above her is Miguel, who mever married but was
<lb/>the father of Enid, Olga, Ulises, Alicia, and two others who died
<lb/>in childhood. Miguel was the only son to go back to live in
<lb/>Ecuador, settling in Guayaquil; when he died in 1935, his cousin
<lb/>Malvina adopted his children and brought them to Quito, where
<lb/>Olga and her family live still. Enid lives in Guayaquil, and Ulises
<lb/>in New York state, West Hempstead, I believe. Alicia, who was
<lb/>brought up not by Malvina, but by Miguelâs âwife,â a lady named
<lb/>Enid Espinosa, who lives or lived in Loja, in Ecuador, may or not
<lb/>still be alive in Mexico, where she was the widow of a military man
<lb/>of some sort of rank. Miguel refused to accept her as his daughter,
<lb/>though she was of all the children probably the one who looked
<lb/>most like him.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Back to the picture: standing next to Miguel is Dolores (âLolaâ),
<lb/>who married a German named Frank Zilker, from Munich. They had one
<lb/>daughter, also named Dolores, (âLolitaâ). Zilker was a widower with
<lb/>three children, one of whom was the wife or girl&#x2010;friend of a man
<lb/>named Malcolm Stevens, whose sister Ruby eventually became...
<lb/>Barbara Stanwyck! The girl, Elizabeth (âSissyâ), eventually died
<lb/>of TB, and Stevens eventually changed his name to Stanwyck. Lola
<lb/>and Zilker didnât make it as a marriage and she finally left him in



<pb n="20" facs="#page-024"/>
<lb/>New Orleans, where, I think, he died in the mid&#x2010;forties. Fate is
<lb/>funny; somehow, in a trunk of old papers from Glenwood Road, I found,
<lb/>and still have, Barbara Stanwyckâs elementary school autograph book
<lb/>from Brooklyn. I guess I should send it to her before either of us
<lb/>dies. Wonder what sheâd say if I asked her how her brother Mal was.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>In the picture again... standing above Mamita is Aquiles. In
<lb/>New York, I believe, sometime around 1911, he married an American
<lb/>girl named Bessie. They had one son, Robert (âBobâ) LÃ³pez, who
<lb/>if still alive now (1983) is about 71; last I heard he was living
<lb/>in LA, divorced. He had some kids too. Aquiles and Bessie didnât make
<lb/>it as a couple either, and went their separate ways. Bessie remarried,
<lb/>a man named Joe Cohen, who was involved with the movies somehow, as
<lb/>was his stepson Bob LÃ³pez. I remember seeing the name in the credits
<lb/>of some films, I think Paulette Goddardâs deathless impersonation of
<lb/>Jezebel was one of them. Something in the technical aspect, cameras
<lb/>or film. Bob visited his cousins in Brooklyn in 1939, and took several
<lb/>very fine family shots. Judging from the pictures, Bob looked a little
<lb/>like Mamita. Aquiles left New York and finally wound up in Buenos
<lb/>Aires, where he was one of the editors of a paper called <hi rend="underline">La NaciÃ³n</hi>.
<lb/>He was a man of some prestige and a bit of a man about town. (At this
<lb/>time EloÃ­sa and Mamita were living with him.) Too much town, too much
<lb/>high life and champagne and tuxedoes; after a party one hight in 1929,
<lb/>he was in the back seat of a car, being driven home by some friends.
<lb/>They noticed that he had stopped talking and turned around to find
<lb/>that heâd just plain dropped dead of a heart attack. Mamita and EloÃ­sa
<lb/>came back to Brooklyn, where she died in 1940. EloÃ­sa finally went
<lb/>back to Ecuador in 1960 or 61, and died in Quito in 1965.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>To the right of Mamita is Samuel, the youngest of the family.
<lb/>He served in the Canadian forces in Europe during WW I, and wound
<lb/>up living in Maracaibo, Venezuela in the twenties. There he married



<pb n="21" facs="#page-025"/>
<lb/>a girl whose name I forget now; her last name, though, was Villanueva.
<lb/>She was very dark, Iâve been told; they came to visit NY on their
<lb/>honeymoon. Her family didnât like Sam, and the feeling was mutual.
<lb/>I think this was in part because the girl wasnât very healthy and
<lb/>her parents had hoped she wouldnât marry. But she did and they had a
<lb/>daughter, Margarita Cecilia, born around 1924. Sam worked for some
<lb/>oil company and was in NY on business alone when he got news that his
<lb/>wife had died. When he went back to Maracaibo he told his in&#x2010;laws that
<lb/>he wanted to go back to NY and take the little girl with him, to which
<lb/>they were adamantly opposed. So opposed, in fact, that they took the
<lb/>little girl and skipped out, vanished. Sam was never able to find them
<lb/>and eventually died in Brooklyn in 1933.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>There is an anecdoe to Sam LÃ³pezâs life and death. He suffered
<lb/>from a mild form of epilepsy; youâd be talking with him and he would
<lb/>occasionally drop off into a little mumbling or silence for a few
<lb/>moments and then come right out of it. This condition, which was probably
<lb/>responsible for his being in the Canadian forces rather than the
<lb/>American, became more pronounced as he grew older; it would happen with
<lb/>increasing frequency and for longer periods. He was diagnosed as having
<lb/>a benign brain tumor and decided to have surgery. Some might say the
<lb/>risks, even in this country, were great in the thirties, but I guess
<lb/>the increasing inconvenience was worse, so he was operated on and died
<lb/>of complications. The anecdote is this: the afternoon before the surgery
<lb/>he and Papa, his brother&#x2010;in&#x2010;law (VÃ­ctor Manuel PazmiÃ±o, for you
<lb/>younger ones), were sitting on the porch swing talking when the
<lb/>Shakespeare clock on the living room mantle struck, and struck, and
<lb/>struck, over and over until it went sproing and stopped. Since the
<lb/>clock had run perfectly ever since FelicÃ­simo and Francisca had bought
<lb/>it in 1900, 33 years earlier (it was part of the home furishings of the
<lb/>outgoing Ecuadorean Consul General, and I have it now), it seemed



<pb n="22" facs="#page-026"/>
<lb/>not unusual that it should break down. Nana always said that this
<lb/>extraordinary coincidence was an omen that was ignored, and I think
<lb/>she was right. She told me that she had taken it to a couple of
<lb/>clocksmiths, but they couldnât find anything wrong with it. It
<lb/>didnât run again until 1969, when I had it repaired in Boston. It
<lb/>still ticks and chimes on my mantle now, but several years ago the
<lb/>strike mechanism went awry, and now itâs anybodyâs guess how many
<lb/>times it will strike every half hour. I find this perversely
<lb/>humorous and have yet to have it looked at.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>And that brings us to the upper right hand figure in the picture,
<lb/>Nana, Lelia, who deserves a book in her own right. She married Papa
<lb/>in Guayaquil in 1898; there were eight children, the PazmiÃ±o LÃ³pez
<lb/>family of chart 1. I should mention that in Latin America itâs the
<lb/>custom for people to use their motherâs maiden name after their
<lb/>fatherâs family name, much as it was the custon in this country
<lb/>years ago to use this same maternal maiden name as a middle name,
<lb/>cf. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Ulysses Simpson Grant, etc. Iâve
<lb/>followed this custom for this essay, to keep things straight. I
<lb/>should also mention that whereas in the US cousin is used for just
<lb/>about everybody besides siblings and nephews, etc., in South America
<lb/>a different system prevails. For example, Stella PazmiÃ±o Disoswayâs
<lb/>children Kenneth and Linda are first cousins to Grace PazmiÃ±o
<lb/>Ganleyâs daughter Joan, as they are to me, son of Lucile PazmiÃ±o
<lb/>Dudley. Lindaâs children and Joanâs are second cousins to each other,
<lb/>but to childless me theyâre first cousins once removed, as I am to
<lb/>them. Joanâs daughter Leslieâs children are first cousins twice
<lb/>removed to Kenneth, Linda, me, etc. And Leslieâs grandchildren
<lb/>would be thrice removed, and so on. In Latin America, a different
<lb/>terminology is used, whereby Joanâs children and Lindaâs are my nieces
<lb/>and nephews <hi rend="underline">en segundo</hi>, âsecond nieces,â
and I would be their <hi rend="underline">tÃ­o en



<pb n="23" facs="#page-027"/>
<lb/>segundo</hi>, âsecond uncle.â Another example: Lolita is Graceâs first
<lb/>cousin, right? Lolita is therefore <hi rend="underline">tÃ­a en segundo</hi> to Joan, (first
<lb/>cousin once removed), <hi rend="underline">tÃ­a en tercero</hi> (twice removed)
to Leslie, and <hi rend="underline">tÃ­a en cuarto</hi> (thrice removed)
<lb/>to Leslieâs children, and so forth. Not too confusing, if you think
<lb/>about it, and all it is is a different way of describing that kind
<lb/>of family relationship. In Ecuador one would say all these people
<lb/>are uncles, nieces, etc.; here one would term them all cousins of
<lb/>some sort since even the distinction between first and second cousins
<lb/>is almost beyond grasp. And as a final example of the American system,
<lb/>to confuse you all, I can mention that since Lolita and Grace, (and
<lb/>Stella and Albert, etc.) are first cousins, then Dennis is second
<lb/>cousin to Joan (and to me, and Laura Lou, and Georgiann, etc.). Dennis
<lb/>lies in the same relationship to me and my first cousins as do the
<lb/>childen of Olga, Ulises, Bob LÃ³pez, not to forget whatever children
<lb/>that long lost daughter of Sam LÃ³pez might have had.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>But now I have to jump back a bit to Ecuador because so far Iâve
<lb/>only written about Nanaâs line and thatâs only half the story. Some
<lb/>details must be given about the PazmiÃ±o side, and the best character to
<lb/>begin with is his mother, DoÃ±a Amalia Hurtado.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>But before I do that, I must first comment on the pictures of
<lb/>two young men, set in ovals, and printed by Baulandâs of Brooklyn.
<lb/>These are two LÃ³pez Romero boys who had died before the 1911 portrait
<lb/>was taken; they were Estenio and Ulises, and you can see where they
<lb/>fit on the appropriate chart, No. 1. Somebody must have taken earlier
<lb/>photos to have these made from them; I would assume that it was
<lb/>Mamita. There isnât too much to tell about them, since they died so
<lb/>young. Estenio was Nanaâs favourite brother and Abuelitoâs favourite
<lb/>son; he had the same high ideals and liberalness of thinking that was
<lb/>so characteristic of that family, and was moved by patriotism to go
<lb/>off and fight with liberal revolutionary forces, dedicated to the



<pb n="24" facs="#page-028"/>
<lb/>overthrow of some dictator (not GarcÃ­a Moreno, another one) before
<lb/>the final victory of Eloy Alfaro and the Liberals in 1895. Unfortunately,
<lb/>he got shot and died on the battlefield. Mamita was dead
<lb/>set against the idea, but there was no discouraging him. Heroic
<lb/>deeds, yes, but living is nicer. Remember, Mamita had had to deal
<lb/>with a lot of misery while FelicÃ­simo was exiled, and now she loses
<lb/>her first son. Hard.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Ulises died as a result of some violent intestinal infection
<lb/>that struck him and EloÃ­sa when the family was living in Guayaquil.
<lb/>EloÃ­sa got better, but as some will recall, always had some sort of
<lb/>trouble with her digestion. I donât remember any stories about him,
<lb/>though Iâm sure Nana or EloÃ­sa had some to tell me. I find the
<lb/>resemblance of Estenio to Nana very striking, but thatâs because
<lb/>Iâve seen so many pictures of Nana when she was a yound lady. As I
<lb/>continue to go through my closet, Iâll xerox some of the better ones.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>I should mention that those of you who donât have any direct
<lb/>memories of Nana or Lola, say, i.e., Lindaâs, or Joanâs younger kids,
<lb/>could get the impression from the reproductions that these people
<lb/>were more darkly complected that they really were. Lola nad Aquiles
<lb/>were nicknamed the ânegritosâ by their siblings, but for the most
<lb/>part, despite the strong Indian features, notably the shape of the
<lb/>eyes, both sides, LÃ³pez and PazmiÃ±o&#x2010;Hurtado were quite fair, very
<lb/>âwhiteâ looking, if you will. Many of the pictures have darkened
<lb/>with age, and xerography, while cheap, isnât the best kind of
<lb/>reproduction. As for the true ethnic or gene background, I can say
<lb/>this: itâs predominantly white, with a strong Indian strain and just
<lb/>a little bit of Black, this latter bit of spice being the legacy of
<lb/>the formidable looking lady whose tale Iâm finally getting to, as
<lb/>follows.
</p>



<pb n="25" facs="#page-029"/>
<head><hi rend="center"><lb/>Amalia Hurtado (Donoso) &amp;<lb/>Francisco Mariano LÃ³pez</hi></head>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>This redoubtable looking but very good lady was Papaâs mother
<lb/>(and Malvinaâs too) and was born in Quito in the late 1830âs or early
<lb/>1840âs. Her mother was named Dolores Zambrano and was the wife of
<lb/>JoaquÃ­n Donoso Baen [sic, actually Donoso Ortiz] (Chart 2);
<lb/>but this gentleman was not her father. That
<lb/>distinction belongs to a man whose last name was Hurtado and who was
<lb/>the 19th century equivalent of a Fuller Brush man, travelling from
<lb/>town to town selling hardware and dry goods. DoÃ±a Dolores probably asked
<lb/>him in to show his wares one day and got more that she perhaps (only
<lb/>perhaps) bargained for. Anyway, thence Amalia, who fits into forth
<lb/>place among the legitimate and not so so children of Donoso and Dolores
<lb/>Zambrano (their names were Camila, Modesto, Teresa, (Amalia, and) Adela).
<lb/>I have a whole list of names of the descendants of these worthies, but
<lb/>there has been no connection for decades, so really, why bother?
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Predictably, Hurtado wasnât seen again; it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> known of him, though,
<lb/>that he was from the coastal province of Los RÃ­os, where blacks
<lb/>constituted a large part of the population. A footnote: in the Andean regions,
<lb/>places of very high altitude... Quito 9500 feet..., there are very few
<lb/>blacks. There is every tint and hue and whatever of white and Indian,
<lb/>but there are almost no blacks. Amalia is quite different from all the
<lb/>other Donoso children, who are, from the pictures Iâve seen and two first
<lb/>cousins of Papaâs, nonagenarians both, whom I met in 1969, almost all
<lb/>white. The picture of her shows her in old age; in an 1860âs tintype I
<lb/>saw in Quito, a hoopskirt and ringlets enhanced the figure of an
<lb/>extremely handsome and attractive young lady. It wasnât a beautiful face,
<lb/>but it was very striking. Insofar as one can trust appearances, she was
<lb/>the source of the curly hair and the "PazmiÃ±o" forehead. Everything I
<lb/>can remember being told about this lady by Nana or Malvina points to
<lb/>a very loving but definitely no&#x2010;nonsense kind of lady, with a shrewd



<pb n="26" facs="#page-030"/>
<lb/>business sense. I have always thought it highly deplorable that this
<lb/>most desirable attribute didnât come with the forehead.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>At any rate, sometime in the 1860âs she met and married JosÃ©
<lb/>Manuel Paz y MiÃ±o, who was considerably older than she; they had
<lb/>several children, most of whom died in infancy. Those who survived
<lb/>were three; Diocelina, Rosario and VÃ­ctor Manuel (Papa), who was
<lb/>born posthumously in 1871. (I donât think thatâs correctly used, but
<lb/>anyway...) This Paz y MiÃ±o belonged to one of the oldest and richest
<lb/>families in Quito, about all of which more later, and he was
<lb/>not in the best of health; Iâve been told that he had kidney trouble
<lb/>or liver problems, I donât recall which; Iâve also learned that this
<lb/>was quite common in those days before that water purification plants
<lb/>made things a bit nicer. Or that might have been someoneâs euphemism
<lb/>for boozers. No telling at this point.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>It should be mentioned that these Donosos, Paz y MiÃ±os, LÃ³pez,
<lb/>DÃ¡lavos and so forth families were all more or less neighbors in
<lb/>Quito; societies were more structured then. Everybody went to the
<lb/>same churches, theatre, events, etc. and everybody who was anybody
<lb/>know everybody else. There are virtues and disadvantages in that, but
<lb/>thatâs the way it was. When Dolores Zambrano died in 1869, FelicÃ­simo
<lb/>LÃ³pez and his brother Francisco were both witnesses to her will.
<lb/>People got together, played cards, danced, acted as eachotherâs
<lb/>doctor, lawyer, etc. Amalia and the LÃ³pez brothers had in common a
<lb/>great love of learning and education; books that belonged to these
<lb/>people that I saw or have myself reveal fairly active though
<lb/>circumscribed tastes, with a penchant towards history and natural sciences
<lb/>and a good deal of current European philosophy. One can only partially
<lb/>underestimate the smallness of numbers of similarly inclined people
<lb/>in mid 19th century Quito. It is therefore easy to understand how the
<lb/>still young Amalia, wife of an older and semi&#x2010;invalid man, could choose



<pb n="27" facs="#page-031"/>
<lb/>no more apt person as her second husband than Francisco Mariano LÃ³pez
<lb/>who was in case Iâve not mentioned it before, the <hi rend="underline">older</hi> brother of
<lb/>FelcÃ­simo. Of this second marriage there were three children (see
<lb/>chart 2), of whom Malvina alone survived into modern times. Malvina
<lb/>was an interesting lady, of whom more later; she was also the last of
<lb/>her generation and line. In genealogical terms, sheâs double related to us
<lb/>(except of course to Lolaâs descendants) because she was Papaâs half&#x2010;sister,
<lb/>and therefore aunt to Stella, George, etc., <hi rend="underline">and</hi> Nanaâs first
<lb/>cousin. In accordance with the system I tediously tried to describe
<lb/>earlier, relatives on both sides nicknamed her âla tÃ­a universal.â
<lb/>It was she who after the death of Miguel Angel LÃ³pez brought up his
<lb/>children, as mentioned earlier, and it was she, in Quito, who was one
<lb/>of the three old lady sisters group in Quito, i.e., Diocelina, Rosario and
<lb/>Malvina. To complete the picture a bit, Diocelina married a man named
<lb/>Trajano Hurtado (no relation to the aforementioned travellinâ man) and
<lb/>they had a bunch of children, of whom the youngest was Enrique, whom some
<lb/>of you will remember. Rosario was first married to a Danish pharmacist
<lb/>named Emil Stahlschmidt and there were two children, Lucila and
<lb/>Guillermo. Stahlschmidt died, also of liver/kidney/booze/shortness of breath,
<lb/>and Rosario later remarried; his name was JosÃ© DÃ¡lavos and there three children:
<lb/>Homero, Edma and Amaya. Some will remember meeting Homero; Edma was very
<lb/>nice, never married, and was a great friend and frequent visitor with
<lb/>Malvina and Enid. Amaya married a Chilean and lives or lived there; she
<lb/>had a son named JosÃ© with whom I exchanged a couple of letters in the
<lb/>early 60âs. But there are more interesting aspects to all this.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Iâve seen a picture of JosÃ© Manuel Paz y MiÃ±o in Quito, a large
<lb/>framed mezzotint kind of thing at Enriqueâs house; he looked like Andrew
<lb/>Jackson with a beard, a white beard, a long white beard. The kind of
<lb/>beard that no one of predominantly Indian, or if you wish, Latino,
<lb/>ancestry could raise.



<pb n="28" facs="#page-032"/>
<lb/>In short, a white man, probably âpure,â much like the Guayaquil
<lb/>grandees I mentioned in connection with Mamita. Amalia, it will be
<lb/>recalled, was probably half white and half white&#x2010;and&#x2010;something, so thatâs
<lb/>the statistical side of it. I say all this is a purely statistical
<lb/>sense; Iâve often heard people say âIâm 1/8 Apache, or one 1/16
<lb/>Micmac... no, really... and it points out a cultural difference we here
<lb/>have with Latin America. The mixing and blending in some areas of the
<lb/>societies there isnât retraceable, nor noteworthy, nor really paid
<lb/>much attention to. It just <hi rend="underline">is</hi>. While the Spaniards did awful things
<lb/>in South America, they didnât exterminate the native population as
<lb/>other Europeans did in North America. In broad terms, colour probably
<lb/>increases or decreases according to social class, and not unfamiliarly
<lb/>so. One can picture the chagrin of some Yankee worthy at seeing his
<lb/>daughter marry one of those <hi rend="underline">(Fill in your own)</hi> fellas. It all has
<lb/>to do with how long one had been around and more or less in control of
<lb/>things. JosÃ© Manuel had many brothers, and there are Paz y MiÃ±os in
<lb/>Quito, and PazmiÃ±os in D.C. and elsewhere, and when Rosario Paz y MiÃ±o
<lb/>v. de Stahlschmidt, later de DÃ¡valos died, two Paz y MiÃ±o cousins paid
<lb/>their respects, but there has never been any contact with any of those
<lb/>families, either on Papaâs part or that of any of the Hurtados, outside
<lb/>of courtesy calls at wakes, etc.

<lb/>Whereas there is a strong family resemblance between the children
<lb/>of both Amaliaâs marriages, there is no trace of that face (JosÃ©
<lb/>Manuel) in anybody descended from Papa known to me, and Iâm the only
<lb/>person now living who had met almost all of them. While Papa resembled both
<lb/>Diocelina and Rosario, he was most like Malvina and her brother Julio.
<lb/>Nana told me that when Annâs mother met Malvina, she was taken aback
<lb/>by the overpowering resemblance to Papa; she of course knew them both
<lb/>in old age and at a span of years, but it was probably very striking
<lb/>throughout their lives. Papa was ten years older than Malvina. I donât

<lb/>know when Amalia married Francisco, but I do know that it was a very
<lb/>happy marriage until her death in 1913. I believe what the people who
<lb/>knew them told me about them. Papaâs surviving correspondence with
<lb/>Francisco is very warm, even in terms of the flowery style of the times.
<lb/>No âstepâ seems to have preceded either the â&#x2010;fatherâ or â&#x2010;sonâ in their
<lb/>relationship. Nana also recalled Francisco, her beloved <hi rend="underline">tÃ­o Pancho</hi>, with
<lb/>the greatest fondness, perhaps despite the fact that it was he who caused
<lb/>her first meeting with Papa. He was, like his brother FelicÃ­simo, a
<lb/>free&#x2010;thinker, a Liberal, etc etc etc, and had done his part to achieve
<lb/>the triumph of Alfaro and the Liberals in 1895, for which he was rewarded
<lb/>with some appointments; he was the Postmaster General for a while, and
<lb/>Minister of this or that at one time. By training, he was a lawyer
<lb/>(cf. the reference to his being present at Dolores Zambranoâs testamenting
<lb/>in 1869) and consequently had a good income. Amalia had inherited some
<lb/>property from Paz y MiÃ±o in the city, plus a small estate named <hi rend="underline">Carretas</hi>
<lb/>(carts) just outside Quito, so she was rather well&#x2010;off in her own right,
<lb/>which was to cause a rather nasty and prolonged family squabble over
<lb/>her will, which in turn required Papa to return to Quito in 1913. It
<lb/>was with the small legacy he received that Papa made the downpayment on
<lb/>2114 Glenwood Road when he returned to Brooklyn in 1918. And thereby
<lb/>hangs a tale, whose <hi rend="underline">raison dâÃªtre</hi> is to explain the great paucity of
<lb/>contacts between the PazmiÃ±o kids in Brooklyn and their many Hurtado and
<lb/>Stahlschmidt and DÃ¡valos first cousins in Quito.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>From all these antecedents, and familiar with the predilection for
<lb/>intermarriage, legitimate, on both sides of the family, and after many
<lb/>hours of perusal of the accompanying and many, many other photographs,
<lb/>my intuition comples me to declare that almost certainly Papa was not
<lb/>the son of JosÃ© Manuel Paz y MiÃ±o, and that his stepfather was also his
<lb/>natural father, that he was therefore full brother to Julio and Malvina

<lb/>and consequently first cousin to Nana in blood as well as name. I first
<lb/>reached this conclusion years ago and asked Nana about it a couple of
<lb/>times. I never really did get a definite answer one way or the other,
<lb/>but I recall that Nana only gave a semi&#x2010;âBahâ about it once, and
<lb/>another time she just smiled and shook her head. The following pages
<lb/>show most of the people mentioned above, so you can pore over the
<lb/>pictures and draw your own conclusions.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Notice how all Amaliaâs children have her distinct rather wide
<lb/>mouth; notice too the very dignified oval portrait of Diocelina, dated
<lb/>August 1, 1897 in Quito, and how very much she reminds one of Stella.
<lb/>One can see a clear relation among Diocelina, Malvina, VÃ­ctor, Julio
<lb/>and DoÃ±a Amalia, but although Rosario has the same mouth and curly hair,
<lb/>the rest of the face says something else enitrely. (The smaller photo of
<lb/>Rosario was dated August 21, 1897, in Quito.) The photo of Julio CÃ©sar
<lb/>has a note on the back to the effect that he died in Guayaquil on June
<lb/>8, 1896 at the age of 17, so please correct my erroneous entry on chart
<lb/>2. He died of yellow fever, and Nana recalled that when the doctors
<lb/>wanted to administer enema to him to clear out his system (I presume
<lb/>this was a contemporary practice) he refused; she attributed his death
<lb/>to this decision and I think it coloured her medical philosophy forever.
<lb/>The four pictures of VÃ­ctor Manuel show him at various stages; the first
<lb/>is dated Quito, December 20, 1895, the second Brooklyn, March 10, 1902;
<lb/>the third and fourth, also from Brooklyn, were probably taken in 1918
<lb/>and 1943, the year before his death. Notice how black his hair still
<lb/>was; when I last saw Malvina she was 88, and much of her still abundant
<lb/>hair was still if not black, very, very dark grey. Unlike VÃ­ctor, and
<lb/>later on his son VÃ­ctor, she never had recourse to that gallant but
<lb/>unconvincing expedient of trying to deny baldness by letting the hair
<lb/>get long on one side and then raking it over the top of the head. (I re<pc>&#x2010;</pc>

<lb break="no"/>member once riding on a roller coaster with VÃ­ctor, who was of course
<lb/>holding his hat in his hand, and having to stifle my laughter at seeing
<lb/>all this long hair flapping in the wind, but only on one side. It
<lb/>would have been unspeakably deflating to mention it at the time, but
<lb/>it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> funny.) And lastly, the picture of the five young ladies was
<lb/>taken on October 30, 1898, and Nana herself wrote their names down.
<lb/>When we would look at these pictures and others, she would always say
<lb/>how careless it was of people not to write on the back who the person(s)
<lb/>in the picture were, just in case. A game for you all: of these ladies,
<lb/>two are sisters&#x2010;in&#x2010;law, two are half&#x2010;sisters, three are sisters, and
<lb/>four are first cousins. Can you identify them all?

<p rend="indent">
<lb/>Sometime around 1910 Malvina married a man named Humberto Egas,
<lb/>who was from Guayaquil and belonged to a family that were friends of
<lb/>FelicÃ­simo and Francisca. The marriage was childless and a flop, and
<lb/>they divorced. But they were still married when DoÃ±a Amalia died in
<lb/>1913. She left a substantial estate, and quarrels arose between
<lb/>Diocelina and Rosario and their families on one side, and Malvina and
<lb/>Humberto and the widowed Francisco on the other. Papa, who had been
<lb/>living in Brooklyn since 1900, went back to Quito to join in the fray
<lb/>and stayed for five years, leaving Nana and the children in the utmost
<lb/>penury. He wanted Nana and the family to go back with him, but Nana
<lb/>refused, in part because of the embarrassing nature of the trip. In
<lb/>1912 the Liberals and Alfaro fell rather catastrophically; Alfaro and
<lb/>many other government officials were killed and mutilated, and it was
<lb/>some time before things settled down. By the time of Amaliaâs death
<lb/>the Conservative government in power had offered amnesties and free
<lb/>passage back to Ecuador to all those expatriate nationals who had
<lb/>been connected with the preceding regime. The newspaper social columns,
<lb/>which still tell of people coming and going today, would carry a



<pb n="32" facs="#page-036"/>
<lb/>notation to the effect that so &amp; so had just returned under the govern<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/>mentâs repatriation/amnesty policy, which Nana thought would be too
<lb/>humiliating. She later regretted this; in her last years, when the
<lb/>poverty had become grinding, she would often tell me that she had
<lb/>never wanted to come to this country in the first place, that the idea
<lb/>was Abuelitoâs and Papaâs and that in any event they had never intended
<lb/>to stay in New York permanently. She was proud that she had never
<lb/>become a citizen; I remember typing a letter for her to some Guayaquil
<lb/>postal official, in which she complained about a letter of hers to a
<lb/>cousin that had been âlostâ; in it she described herself as âuna
<lb/>ecuatoriana ausente de mi patria durante muchos aÃ±os.â It was at the
<lb/>time 60 years since she had left Ecuador.

<lb/>I think when Papa came back in 1918, it was very much against his
<lb/>wishes and judgement. But he did and thatâs why weâre all here. And
<lb/>all that is part of the next chapter aka the PazmiÃ±o LÃ³pez family.

<lb/>One final note: DoÃ±a Amaliaâs portrait, sent to Papa and Nana, is
<lb/>inscribed thusly (I translate): âThe original (of this picture) loves
<lb/>you argently and wishes you prosperity in the course of this miserable
<lb/>life. Quito, August 6, 1908.â When I read that to Nana, she laughed,
<lb/>and said that DoÃ±a Amalia was being sarcastic, that she had a sense
<lb/>of humour about life.

<lb/>such legalities)
<lb/>In Quito on January 23, 1873, before the judge named below and in the
<lb/>presence of witnesses who were present, Dolores Zambrano, legally adult
<lb/>and single, finding herself close to death, said: that she recognized
<lb/>her daughter Amalia Zambrano as her own and natural daughter: Mr. Manuel
<lb/>Paz i MiÃ±o, together with his legal wife Miss Amalia Zambrano, who were
<lb/>both present, expressed that they accepted this recognition, and in connection
<lb/>with that they would sign this document, together with the witnesses and
<lb/>the judge who certifies below. In this regard it is noted that the lady
<lb/>does not sign herself because she is physically unable to do so. It is also
<lb/>noted that this negotiation is attested to by this simple paper (rather
<lb/>than legal paper) because it is nine oâclock at night and the appropriate
<lb/>seal (or stamps) are not to be had at this time, and therefore the paper is
<lb/>to be made legal, to which I also certify. Dated as above.
<lb/>She also said that everything she leaves is for all her children. I certify it.

<lb/>(The attached is on the reverse and refers to the paper being

<lb/>It is clear on the original, different color ink, as it is here that
<lb/>the phrase beginning "She also said" was added later and in a different
<lb/>hand, not apparently that of anyone who signed, and all crowded in above
<lb/>the signatures. Since this is 1873, and refers to Papaâs grandmother, the
<lb/>other "children" would be Papaâs aunts, not his sisters, but it could have
<lb/>been added in 1913, when Amalia Zambrano (Hurtado &#x2010; Paz y Mino &#x2010; Lopez)
<lb/>died in one of the many many twists of the great inheritance fight.
<lb/>NB The presance of Felicisimo and Francisco as witnesses shows that
<lb/>the families knew each other well enough to act as legal witnesses before
<lb/>old man Paz Y Mino died. (I erroneously thought Papa was a posthumous child.)
<lb/>Francisco Lopez must have married Amalia viuda de Paz y Mino sometime around
<lb/>1878, as there were kids other than Malvina, who was born in 1881.
