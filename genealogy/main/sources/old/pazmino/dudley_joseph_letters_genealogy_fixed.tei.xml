<lb/>Dear Lindar
<lb/>I was very happy to get your letter yesterday, and before anything else, the
<lb/>current address is ii,62 Castro, SF 9UllU (I|.l5) ij.31-88l4l.. Oh, and I use Joseph now,
<lb/>not Joe. I was Joe for years, but after a while I felt it didn't fit, and Joey was
<lb/>certainiy out of vogue and inappropriate, I mean, after all...I am 3Ui
<lb/>Sort of creeps up on you, doesn't it? It just slips by so quickly, and you mellow as
<lb/>it races by and things get more and more distant in the past, and then something comes
<lb/>up, either a new experience which reminds you of something you've experienced, or a
<lb/>situation arises, as with your kids, in which you are obliged to recall things that
<lb/>have lain forgotten down there someplace, and it all comes back, and it's a good
<lb/>feeling, at times.Sure, I'll tell you as much as you want to hear, and probably more
<lb/>than that at times. You know how I love to run off at the mouth, and the yeara have
<lb/>only made that tendency stronger, but with greater judgment and to people who are â
<lb/>better chosen, because they show an interest. So let's start off with me.
<lb/>The enclosed snapshot was taken at a,party at ny flat here in SF g3ven to celebrate
<lb/>via a musicale(played by ny teacher, not me) the arrival of ny new two-manual harpsichord,^,
<lb/>A clever friend of mine took it at precisely the moment when I was escplaining to somoene f... :â¢
<lb/>that you don't hit it like a piano, but gently stroke the keys, because they pluck,
<lb/>not strike, the strings. My hair was longer then thah I wearit now,, and there is now
<lb/>a bit less of it than there was before, mainly becaise I wear it. shorter now, curly. -
<lb/>I have noticed with the passage of time that I am destined to have a magnificent Victor- .
<lb/>like forehead, the temple of my intellect, etc. I once thought of this as of the curse
<lb/>of the Pazminos, that once you lost your hair, it was Ì 1 over, etc. Well, I'm past 'â 
<lb/>that now, not only because the forehead itself looks good, but also because I am told
<lb/>by the young men I occasionally involve myself romantically with (move over, fellow
<lb/>skeleton, this family closet is narrow) that it makes me look sexyj I don't know about
<lb/>you, but my thirties so far, with a few exceptions, have been the best part of ry life.
<lb/>What happened to Harvard? I got sick of it, andafter the first year the government
<lb/>withdrew, not ray grant, but the entire program from which the fundscame, and I lost
<lb/>interest. I worked teaching at a small college in Boston for 2 years to makeraoney and pay
<lb/>phd tuition, but that got old quickly, and I started working as an editor at Houghton
<lb/>Mfflin in Boston, fgn lang texts (if any. of this is old news, bear with me...i don't
<lb/>remember when last I spoke/wrote with/to you), which was a lot of money(got me through
<lb/>ly goodies stage of life) but which was like working for a bank. Finally went on vacation
<lb/>and convention combination trip to SF, moved here four mths later. I'fy first job here was
<lb/>in a pornographic bookstore, owned by a friend of mine, sitting behind the hblihte'rp'a
<lb/>few hrs a week, all under the counter- T^is got to be a bore tooj after one day one gets
<lb/>familiar with and saturated by the reading material (great cast of thousands, but the
<lb/>plots are dull as shit) and the only thing left to do is watch the Â«?ustoraers, which is
<lb/>fun. Then I got a job teaching English as a 2nd language to Spanish speakers in a federally
<lb/>funded city administered program. That lasted two years, witnessed complete changes of
<lb/>professional personnel(teachers) but strange permanence of local nepotistic (?) administra
<lb/>tion, local latinos, and their brothers-in-law, you can fill in the lines between the dots.
<lb/>Then I didn't work for months, had a deep and disastrous affair, contemplated suicide,
<lb/>finally realized that that was no good because there isn't anybody around any more who can
<lb/>give a decent eulogy, got a job (which I'm at now) in the mornings, mere clerical stuff.
<lb/>I'm here i|. hrs, work generally one, write letters, read, listen to music, nap, etc. On
<lb/>weekend nights I bus tables at a Hungarian restaurant owned by a friend, where I hope to
<lb/>be made waiter, which I do, practice-training style) now two nights midweek. So what
<lb/>happened to Harvard, to the PhD, to the academic career? It got old, and I decided that
<lb/>imnt my time for myself and ly interests. I am fortunate in that I have only lyself to
<lb/>csre about, worry over, feed, clothe and shelter, so why should I spend even one minute
<lb/>doing something dreary (research for papers I don't care about-publish or perish.
<lb/>work in an office and make lots bread-have no time to enjoy, or anything tiresome lie
<lb/>that, especially when it s impossible to get teaching jobs. I do ly "things" and enjqy
<pb n="2" facs="#page-001"/>
<lb/>whatever good things of life that come ray way, and tl^re are plenty. How do I live?
<lb/>Boyally, I might even say qieenly, i|62 Castro is a nine room Victorian flat right in
<lb/>the middle of the "gay" ghetto, near to everything I need in rty life, shopping, movies,
<lb/>bars, stores, etc, all trolley (REAL TROLLEY CARS) and bus lines.I have 2 roommates,
<lb/>one, one of my oldest and closets friends, anf the other a nice and ehh. unobtrusive
<lb/>fellnw from upstate NY. The place is in try narae, costs 175 a rath(total), and is palatial.
<lb/>The landlord, perhaps the last great man on earth, has paid for all the renovation of
<lb/>this marvelous flat, which for decades suffered under the -Pontius Pilate of cheap enamel,
<lb/>by the coatioad, ugly wallpaper, no inspiration, etc. Landlord, hereinafter referred to as
<lb/>Art, said that it was worth the expense(deductible, too) to have the place fixed xp by
<lb/>people who love their home, and he's tickled pink to have such good tenants. Hopes we stay
<lb/>20years. I could ramble on endlessly, but I'll spare you that for the time(l Ì  go on)
<lb/>and merely say that it's wonderful to have someone to pay for all your decorating ideas,
<lb/>to enable you to let yair fancy fly freely, and be happy with the resiilt. The nicest part
<lb/>is that the :^ent is more or less at a 19U7 level. One pays 175 for a studio and feels luclqjy,
<lb/>So that s me of the past few years.
<lb/>Family news first, then histojy. Dg&amp;ais is thinking of marrying again, is in fact
<lb/>engaged to some divorcee with kids he met in Rochester, where he has lived for over 12
<lb/>years or so. He is now 32, Lolita is most anxious that he not make another mistake like
<lb/>the last one(a Mormon girl named Bonnie who was crazy, alas), but Tony says he's 32 &amp;
<lb/>can take the consequences .^'3iain?a"X'ou'"'has'^ babv girlTjo"^ is many times a grandmother,
<lb/>her thrid daughter Lynn has married and divorced, etc. "Leslie's husband, Tomny, is a good
<lb/>boy, works hard, and they live in comfortable middle class elenagce in Bergen Beach, which
<lb/>in our day was flatlands but now is all subdivision-suburbia in urbs. Karen lives, married
<lb/>w/one kid, in the LA area near Joan. Bobby has one son, married to Wanda, a IHC PR girl who
<lb/>was pleasant. Alas, there has been a tragedy. GeorgiannJ.s husband, Tim, several mths ago
<lb/>fell off a scaffold and was killed, at 32 or so. "tmd two kids and was expecting a 3rd.
<lb/>It was very hard for her, and it came at a time when I was very low myself. I got a boost
<lb/>in the arm, because she told me that a couple of letters I wrote her, in response to her
<lb/>intense grief, had helped her to see some things more clearly and find aiÂ«y to make life
<lb/>work againj it made mefeel useful, and I needed that at the time. She is now planning to
<lb/>move back to Bklyn, as South Carolina (Rock Hill) is unpiasant as a widow, aid she needs
<lb/>people.to talk with. Angelo died recently, the cause given was phlebitis, but George said
<lb/>that he had lost an immense amount of weight beforehis cfeath, so I have a hunch it was
<lb/>cancer. Minnie lives on in Florida, in the place she and my father lived in when he
<lb/>died; she must be very lonely, and I feel sorry for her. But not that sorry; I have the
<lb/>feeling that a good deal of the estrangement that existed between ny father and me^for
<lb/>some time before he died was due to her, or at least to her presence and ity father snot
<lb/>wanting to rock the boat, a s it were. I wrote him when I learned of his terminal--illness., ,
<lb/>but he never answered; I spoke to him two days before he died, but I doubt whether he
<lb/>realized it was me. I had the comfortable kno^rledge of finding out that the last couple
<lb/>of days he was talking a lot about me and my mother. Poor man, he just couldn't open up
<lb/>to me, and it was too late. ââ- '
<lb/>Enid is married, about three years now, an old friend named Aurelio Granda. I hear
<lb/>from Malvina, the last of that generation, now 93, but that's about it. Addresses are
<lb/>the same, ksr the most part, except Grace; they now live on New York Avenue...I can include
<lb/>addresses later and give you all tte materials you need to start writing letters.
<lb/>Funny you should mention Superman Laundry bag, I've never forgotten that, and was
<lb/>just using it as a metaphor to some friends a few days ago. That's a family trait, you
<lb/>know...ability to recall events and funny things that other people would have long ago
<lb/>forgotten. How odl do you suppose we were when you said that, crushingme to bits? It was
<lb/>about the same time I accidentally pushed you down the back stairs, I think. That was
<lb/>30 years ago, or close to it.
<lb/>I knew, as we disposed of the chattels at 695, that someday you and/or Kenneth would
<lb/>look back and regret what was being discarded, but that's the way things were then, and
<pb n="3" facs="#page-002"/>
<lb/>there's no use regretting it overly now. It happened. I have no idea what happened to
<lb/>it allj asecond hand furniture dealer took a lot...Eloisa took care of that with Lola,
<lb/>Nam, couldn't go over there(l'^y God, your mother s death was hard on Nana....n5r God...
<lb/>dMr a woman of Ì ^ana's strength, of her resistance...but later for that) Grace has a
<lb/>cedar chest, the one that was on the second floor landing, George has that long glass doorec
<lb/>bookcase from the sewing room; I used to have the small one from the hall..-I gave it to
<lb/>George, I think. There might be a few odds and ends, but that's it. Things go the way of
<lb/>people who enter your life and pass through; if you don't hold on to what is important,
<lb/>it's gone. And what's ij|portant to hold on to is not things, but memories, the experiences
<lb/>of events, from which one can learm, derive pleasure( a joke, funny thing), or what have
<lb/>you. That was tiy legacy from 2111;, in addition to- some dishes and glasses and a bunch of old
<lb/>photographs, that nobody else wanted at the time; memories, lessons in how to live, or at
<lb/>least how to survive. I can't tell you how much I -got from growing up with Nana and Victor;
<lb/>I learned about three generations, and it helped me immeasurably to understand other
<lb/>members of my family, your mother, Albert, etc. Perhaps more than anyone else in my gena-
<lb/>ratioh, I have an understanding of ow^parents and what they went through, aid why they
<lb/>are/were who/what they are/were. And as for human experience, the incredible variety of
<lb/>human drama that I saw or heard of-ior Â±hhh learned, or went through... .sone times try heart
<lb/>just fills up and I can't talk. Do you know that in all theyears I lived on Glenwood Road,
<lb/>there was never an argument that I saw. There were hard and good times, moments of crisis
<lb/>(mainly financial) or discomfort (talk about euphemismsJ) but I never witnessed an argu
<lb/>ment. I'm sure there were, but I never saw one; I know of nobody else who can say that.,.^
<lb/>_â  So now for some details, rather ramblings. Pans was Lcl''" . born on Aug 26, :

<lb/>^^im when her father, felicisimo Lop^( lU they lived,
<lb/>to Quito; he had been elected senator artS"'"t'hs triu..pli of ff._ Liberal government in 1895.
<lb/>This was in 1397; when they carae back to Guayaquil-he came too and the got married. Victor
<lb/>was born in l899m and they came to ill in 1900 when he was 8 mths old. Abuelito had been
<lb/>named Consul General in NT, and shortly after he arrived,the president dT"^feuador, Eloy
<lb/>Alfaro, named hiw Minister Plenipotenciary to Venezuela; Papa was named Consul in his place.

<lb/>TuuTap to fiândle you; you, not familiar to seeing an old, very old face, started to cry
<lb/>like hell. Everybody laughed, including Mamita, who by this time had had ample experience
<lb/>with babiesi She died in October, simply, peacefully. Who is Malvina? She is
<lb/>Nana's first cousin and Papa's half sister, which at first glance looks very confusing.
<lb/>It isn't. Papa's mother was a widow with three kids(surviving); she met and married a man
<lb/>who was Nana's uncle, Francisco Lopez, brother of Abuelito; They had two kids, one of whom
<lb/>is Malvina, born l88l. There was a brother, Julio Cesar, who died of yellow fever in 1897.
<lb/>Is any of this important? Tes, a lot of it is, at least to me. It's nice to know where
<lb/>you come from, and if you have a grandmohter who tells you stories, you leam mich. I
<lb/>firmly believe that personality traits are passed like physical traits through the genes.
<lb/>For example: Mamita was- tire illegitimate niece of a man named Gabriel Garcia Moreno, who
<lb/>was a dictator of Ecuador in the 19th centu^. a religious fafaatic . an'j), ,

<lb/>slights and faults. If once you were crossed off in his mind, you had no hope of ever again
<lb/>being accepted. And he was "peppeiy", capricious. Hana said to me a couple of times that
<lb/>she felt that certain aspects of Sloisa, your mother, and even ilamita, were traceable to
<lb/>this family s genes, and Nana told it like she saw it. There's a funny tale about how
<lb/>your father once told Victor, I think in a mlment of forehead slapping, that "Stella can
<lb/>be difficult at times'.' And ycu know how careful one had to be with what one said a round
<lb/>Eloisa. So from the (SFaroia Moreno blood, we get mjr, iTrrnossibleness. our 3,tLUbb.Qriiess..

<lb/>studied with Heifitz who had in turn studied with Joachim who studied xmth Paganini. And
<lb/>I'm one step closer to it becaise Nana raised me, andbecause I .listened to what she
<lb/>taled. From the Pazmino side(Papa was another chapter entirely) we get our dreaminess, our

<lb/>unwillingness to accept the pettiness and lack of inspiration of the "real" world. But we
<lb/>go on; is there really much difference between the folly of maintianing that ramshackle
<lb/>ruin at 2111; for years, and Don Quixote's charging off after windmills? Is there not a
<lb/>tiraelessness to the sense of educating childred, of raising them with love and interest, and
<lb/>teaching them things, a la Victor and Nana? Is it not strange, or perhaps just reiuarkable,
<lb/>that whenever there has been crap in family affairs, it has been through the intervention
<lb/>and| presence of outsiders, of people not of the blood, so to speak? And from this, it
<lb/>becomes eventually clear to see why as a whole our family makes such Jbad raarraiges. They
<lb/>range from bad mistakes to non-malicious misunderstandings, but for the most part they
<lb/>don't work. Fortunately, our generation finds better solutions to these centretenips. And
<lb/>perhaps of all, my solutions are the best, becaise of the code of behaviour of my circle.

<lb/>Dear Lindaj
<lb/>So I write you ^nd you v/rmte me and I take an eternity to
<lb/>answer. Fine situation, especially after I blow off about my
<lb/>answering letters as sbon as they come. Guess I'm getting lazier.
<lb/>Anyway, here goes another, and thanks for the snapshots, you
<lb/>know, it's remarkable how much you resenble your mother at that
<lb/>age; being the semi-official custodian of old family snapshots
<lb/>lets one see physical resemblances as they develop/vanish with
<lb/>time. I used to look like my father when j was very little, and
<lb/>that vanished, the only remnants currently remaining being a
<lb/>marked tendency to get freckles on my shoulders after every
<lb/>summer's color-feast, and a red mustache...well, reddish at
<lb/>the ends at any rate. He s been (bad two years now, and I get
<lb/>sporadic letters from Minnie, the latest a month ago. She hasn't
<lb/>been well at all physically, having just had some horrible-soundi
<lb/>ng stomach/intestinal infection that required 5 transfusions,
<lb/>she also had another heart attack a while back, poor woman. She
<lb/>misses him terribly, she still lives where they did in Florida,
<lb/>and goes and vislta her real children and the two foster kids
<lb/>they adopted.
<lb/>As for your question^, I'll answer them as I reread your
<lb/>letter. Yes, Dennis is a photographer still, and,still living in
<lb/>Rochester, A while back Lolita told me he was gojng to get
<lb/>married again; she and Tony had some reservations, because the
<lb/>girl/woman ms a widow with two kids and a whole mess of serious
<lb/>back/spine trouble which would require surgery, but they decided
<lb/>to let him make up his own mind without any advice or negative
<lb/>reaction, A while later I heard that he had changed his mind.
<lb/>Not only did he have so many toys...i think most of it is still
<lb/>laying about the place on E 5'^th st, as Lolita writes that die an
<lb/>tony are about to start cleaning out all t^is junk. He really was
<lb/>spoiled as a kid; I remember thinking that he always got whatever
<lb/>he wanted, too much, I remember once, when we were older, saying
<lb/>soinething about that and how my childhood had some rather differs
<lb/>nt aspects to it, how I had to work for all that and do the
<lb/>whole thing about college by myself, etcetc.(I was being a bore
<lb/>that day) and Lola said something like '^Thatds rightl? I wonder
<lb/>whatever became of that cooky Bom-iie he wqs married to for a whil
<lb/>she was really strange, looking back, (I'd never get an award fo
<lb/>my typing, so bear with me.)
<lb/>Joan and Bob are still together; as usual, he's in the midst
<lb/>of landing some great new job that will bring in thousands, etc
<lb/>etc, Joan just bears up. They live pretty well in southern cal,
<lb/>in one of those endless subdivisions around LA. Leslie is married
<lb/>and has two kids; they live in the Bergen Beach'"section, all of
<lb/>which is now houses and shopping centers. Karen and Lvnn are both
<lb/>divorced and have one kid; they live down'"'"WeFe""tbb. Lynn is
<lb/>getting a degree in some sort of psychological counselling, she's
<lb/>22 now, and really very together. Talking with her and Karen is
<lb/>fun, because they're grown up people now, and the rela-tionship is
<lb/>different. The otiser kids, all six of them, are boisterous,health
<lb/>typical southern cal, kids.in many ways I'm reminded of Nana by
<lb/>Joan, Victor once agreed with me, about the endless hardships and
<pb n="9" facs="#page-008"/>
<lb/>financial precipices joan and Nana had to go through all their
<lb/>lives. X was Just down in LA for 5 days and went out to visit.
<lb/>His parents live in the 4.rea too, which drives Joan crazy, as she
<lb/>can't stand them, Grace and wally are fine; he's quite heavy now,
<lb/>and.will be soon iBtiring from his Job as a security guard. They
<lb/>plan to get a camper, drive across country and settle for their
<lb/>declining years near joan. They live on .New York Ave around Bever
<lb/>ly Rd, That neighborhood is totally black now, and very bad, from
<lb/>what I hear, wally got mugged and badly beaten up on a subway
<lb/>station by some black teenagers, Joan wants them to come out now,
<lb/>but if they come now, he loses all his retirement benfits, so they
<lb/>plan to stick it out. From what Lolita tells me, it would break
<lb/>your heart to see Flatbush now. Flatbush Ave around church is all
<lb/>black; all the shops are gone, or are boarded up, and in some
<lb/>blocks the shopkeepers will only open the door for customers after
<lb/>they come to see who it is. The entire corner of Flatbust, Farragul
<lb/>and Rogers is wrecked, burnt-out,deserted buildings, and the block
<lb/>where the A&amp;P was is a no-man's-land. The enclosed article, sent
<lb/>by Lolita, will show you something familiar and give you an oppor
<lb/>tunity to see how the area is writte n about euphemistically. I
<lb/>imagine Glenwood and East 19th are still pretty much ok, but they'r
<lb/>islands in a sea of waste. I don't plan to ever go back and look;
<lb/>it would be a series of unpleasant experiences, and who needs thati
<lb/>Laura and Al are still at 2620. Laura Lou is married and has e
<lb/>daughter named Kimberley. They live in...I go rget where now.
<lb/>Bobby and his wife and son live in the Bnonx somewhere. He's doing'
<lb/>counselling work, Ronny and Lisa are still at home.
<lb/>I wrote you, I think, about the terrible accident which mad,e
<lb/>Georgiann a widow with three kids. sh#^s back in Bklyn now and iis
<lb/>buying a house across the street from George and Ann, Her brotiibr
<lb/>Angelo died, supposedly of phlebitis, about three motnhs ago, I
<lb/>tend to think it was EnanKW cancer, though, as George told me that
<lb/>Angelo had been losing a great deal of weight over a period of time
<lb/>and Just refused to see a doctor, I remember that Ann's mother,
<lb/>that awful virago of a woman, died of cancer, but some people have
<lb/>a fear of saying the word cancer, so the story was that she had
<lb/>had a heart attack and died in the bathroom, one doesn't lose wei
<lb/>ght with phlebitis; besides, that particular malaise Just became
<lb/>fashionable after Nixon, johnny pazmino is now 29 andstill living
<lb/>at home, unmarried, with no desires to get married, from what I
<lb/>hear. The youngest sister, BarbSa Ann, must be about 20 now, but
<lb/>I don't recall what she's doing, whether working or going to
<lb/>college or what, she's still at home too,
<lb/>I have just a few vague memories of my mother; I could pro
<lb/>bably count theÂ«; on the fingers of one hand. Every now and then
<lb/>something will trigger some buried memory and I'll remember some
<lb/>thing else, but for the most part" what I knov? of her I've gotten
<lb/>from other people, Nana, Lolita, Grace, Joan, etc. My physical
<lb/>recollection of her is faceless; I remember the person and the
<lb/>body, but not the face directly. That I can only get from the
<lb/>many snapshots of her, she died of heart trouble on March 27, 1946
<lb/>when I was just under six years old, I don't knov? whether you knew,
<lb/>but she had had rheumatic fever as a child, and no one knew about
<lb/>it; later on, as a teenager, she was extremely athlTetic, and used
<lb/>to play Softball with Albert and George and their friends, in
<lb/>Erasmus she was on the track team, among other things, and that
<pb n="10" facs="#page-009"/>
<lb/>couldn't have helped her condition any. Also, carrying me was a
<lb/>tremendous strain on her; she had three good years or so after
<lb/>I was born, but then it caught up with her, she had alv^ays been a
<lb/>bit feeble as a young lady, before marrying my father, which
<lb/>occurrence, by the way, proceeded my birth by about 6 months, i
<lb/>think they put it all off(they were going together for years and
<lb/>years before that) because of the hard times of the depression and
<lb/>the knowledge that she was SiSEiE sort of weak, she, my father, &amp;
<lb/>wally and Grace went on a long touring vacation through upstate
<lb/>NY and Eastern Canada in September of '39, and I think that was
<lb/>when the slip occurred that precipitated the marriage. All this I
<lb/>found out through finding old papers, like marriage certificates,
<lb/>etc; Nana never mentioned it, and when i once broached the subject
<lb/>with my father, he just sort of got a bit angry and changed the
<lb/>subject. It didn't bother me any; i was just curious; however, his
<lb/>moral attitude belonged to another generation than mine, as did
<lb/>Nana's, I do know, though, that it was a good marr&amp;age, that they
<lb/>were.very much in love with eachother, I've heard that from joan
<lb/>many times, and she remembers them together, being 8 years older,
<lb/>127 father and l were somewhat estranged at the time of his
<lb/>death, rather through mutual neglect more than anything else. Also,
<lb/>Minnie was fond of running me into the ground "tecause of what she
<lb/>imagined to be slights in my filial sense of duty, Mhile I feel
<lb/>sorry for her now, I recognize that she is a woman of rather limi
<lb/>ted understandingm and prone to gossipping. She and Ann were as
<lb/>thick as litss fleas, and whenever they got together, I can just
<lb/>imagine what was said, fe/hen I was living in Boston, I would go
<lb/>down to nY occasionally, and if they heard about it, Minnie would
<lb/>get angry that I hadn't made the trip(a long and broing one it
<lb/>was, too) on the LIRRto see them on the island, i was never in
<lb/>NY for more than a few days, and a trip out there was a whole day
<lb/>thing, I did visit them a few times, but not each and every time
<lb/>I was in NY, so that got her off, I asked them up to Boston to
<lb/>visit I don't knov/ how many times; they could fly free because my
<lb/>stepbrother (that sounds too intimate,..! haven't seen him in 10
<lb/>years),.,her son Ronnie was a pilot and parents of pilots fly free.
<lb/>They travelled a bit on that deal, even went to Hawaii once, I
<lb/>think. But they'd never come to Boston. The only time I heard from
<lb/>my father was one night when Minnie was in the hospital undergoing
<lb/>a gall bladder operation, and he was lonely, Â® he called. He never
<lb/>wrote me; I don't have a sample of his handwriting to this day.
<lb/>She would write, laconically, and she even once got angrp because
<lb/>I didn't answer each and every letter and postcard, when I heard
<lb/>he was-dying i wrote him twice, long, deep letters, in which I
<lb/>spoke of my feelings towards him and his towards me and s,sked him
<lb/>to come out here to visit me, I didn't have the money to go back
<lb/>then; I wasn't working then, and I frankly felt that l wasn't
<lb/>under any moral obligation to do so. He never answered, i spoke
<lb/>with him two days before he died, but I know that his mind wasn't
<lb/>all there any more, due to the cancer, and the medication, and i
<lb/>doubt he realized, i heard from wally, v/ho calls Minnie every now
<lb/>and then on the watts line in the place he works at, that those
<lb/>last days he(rny father) would ramble on incoherently about my
<lb/>mother and me. That must have been rough for Minnie, because I
<lb/>don't think he recognized het at the end. Her retribution for
<lb/>being such a bitch at times. As ye sow, so 5ahll ye reap, or some
<lb/>thing like that.
<pb n="11" facs="#page-010"/>
<lb/>papa was a hard man to live with, according to Nana, His
<lb/>children were terrified of him, and I'm sure he deserved the re
<lb/>putation. in l,glg_Jiis mother died and he went back to Quito to
<lb/>settle some inheritance suits between him aid his two full sisters
<lb/>and Malvina, his half sister(also Nana's first cousin), who had
<lb/>been egged on to grab as much as she could from pona Amalia's
<lb/>reputedly considerable estate by her neer-do-well husband Hector
<lb/>ESas(not the Hector you met sometime in the fifties) The suit
<lb/>lasted years, and I'm sure there was a good deal of dalliance too.
<lb/>In aay event, he returned with very little, in fact, just enough
<lb/>to buy 2ll4(accoin:ding to the old mortgage system before FDR) ,
<lb/>and a changed man, coming'back to responsibilities, children,
<lb/>duties, after five years of the soft life over there embittered
<lb/>him, and he was never able to provide for his family. Hence, the
<lb/>real provider all those years was victor, I could, and will some
<lb/>day, write reams about Victor; in many ways, I consider him my
<lb/>father figure. His failures came later in life, since he was always
<lb/>a no^-pushy type of man in a world and a line of business that
<lb/>required pushiness to a higlj,. degree. But it was victor, and really
<lb/>almost exclusively Victor, that provided for Nana and the younger
<lb/>kids, as well as me, for years and years; he bore the brunt. It's
<lb/>a great shame that he and your mother had that big argument, becau
<lb/>that prevented you, as you say, from being over there as much as ^
<lb/>you were when we were very little and you didn't get a chance to
<lb/>know them as I did, or Joan did. But that's life, your mother
<lb/>had some personality traits that Nana once described as the curse
<lb/>of the G-arcia Morenos, some of which Eloisa had too: a certain
<lb/>intractability, an absoluteness, an intransigence about some thingÂ£
<lb/>and some people there's a fumiy story about how once after a
<lb/>scene with her before you were born, about something inconsequen
<lb/>tial, your father said to Victor "you know, Stella can be a little
<lb/>difficult at timesV Again, that's life, I'm sure that a lot of
<lb/>her personality was formed, or distorted, as a child, by living
<lb/>with papa(which is why I got off on that taxigent above), because
<lb/>he was an awful father. Just terrible, George was terrified of
<lb/>him as a child, and t think papa got off on the feeling of mastery
<lb/>and power, since he was such a pov^erless, ineffective man. in
<lb/>later years he mellowed out, and had a particular affection for
<lb/>Joan, who remembers him with great warmth, she was his pet, as
<lb/>Leslie was Victor's later on, wow, how Victor spoiled Lesliei
<lb/>Joan as a little girl once complained to papa that his moustache,
<lb/>reddish like mine, that he had had for over fifty years, tickled
<lb/>fexmxs^hsnher when she kissed him goodbye and hello; he shaved it
<lb/>off the next morning, Nana was dumbfounded, i have two memories
<lb/>of him; I was four when he died, and it was to partly console Nana
<lb/>and partly to help take care of my mother, who by that time v/as
<lb/>starting to get sick and needed care, that we moved from Foster,
<lb/>ihere Grace, wally, jOan, my parents and I shared an apartment,
<lb/>to 2114, The two memories of Papa are one day his showing me his
<lb/>papers and little crafty things he did, liki those furry notebooks
<lb/>and picture frames he made, up in his room, which was later on
<lb/>mineg: on the tliird floor(he slept in the front room, which was
<lb/>later Alfred's, and in which he died, as did Alfred, but the room
<lb/>upstairs v?as his den; his desk was there and it was his retreat.
<lb/>The other memory is of when he was dying; he lapsed into a coma for
<lb/>two days before he died at 71 of uremia(which also was the main
<pb n="12" facs="#page-011"/>
<lb/>cause o.f Lola's death at 83)Â» but before that he was conscious
<lb/>and I remember hearing him call for victor, and seeing him(V)
<lb/>and Nana standing near papa's bed talking, poor
<lb/>his frustrations and ^ust couldn't handle them. He was an in
<lb/>telligent man, but not as much as Hana,
<lb/>you knov;, behind the domestic exterior, and the incredibly
<lb/>careworn face and body, Nana v^as an extremely intelligent woman.
<lb/>She had an incredibly mind and a prodigious memory, ne&amp;ther of
<lb/>which failed her until the last few months of her life; She
<lb/>herself told me that she felt she v.-asn't going to be around too
<lb/>much longer a few weeks before she died, as it turned out, she
<lb/>had had a series of minor hemorrhages(How does one spell that?)
<lb/>before the big one that brought about her death, and she felt
<lb/>it. Had her life been easier, she might have lived more than
<lb/>the 85 years she did; I took her to see Shaminon three mths
<lb/>before her death, for her hearing, which he totally restored by
<lb/>flushing out the impacted wax (can you imagine?... she was hard
<lb/>of hearing for years^i and the reason was just impacted wax.')
<lb/>and he told me he wished he had her organs. But, but, he said
<lb/>ha:'arteries were like pipes,; arteriosclerosis is an unavoidable
<lb/>part of ageing, and that was what killed her. The rest of her
<lb/>would have lasted longer, but,,.Nana's voice and her eyes were
<lb/>those of a middle aged woman at the most, until the last few
<lb/>weeks, as the mechanism of the body started to break down, her
<lb/>eyes had a sparkle and a depth not often seen in people that
<lb/>age. And one could go on endlessly about liana's humanity, her
<lb/>abnegation, he understanding and kindness. An incredible woman,
<lb/>you know, v^hen she died, it was as if the house knew it.
<lb/>Things broke down; things like the toilet bowl, which cracked,
<lb/>and other things. It was sold to a guy named sturgis, who re
<lb/>paired it almost singlehandedly; he was a coxntractor, it's still
<lb/>man; he had
<lb/>He was an in-
<lb/>there, but the porch is off, covered with one of those
<lb/>aluminum sidings; I guess that's the only thing that could be
<lb/>done to it to fight the cold and the dry-rot, etc, but it de
<lb/>natured the place, it was sold because nobody had the money to
<lb/>fix it up at the time; for a .short while it seemed as if Albert
<lb/>might do it, and thereby silence forever Laura's mouthing off abi
<lb/>out having a house like her brothers, but it was too much for
<lb/>him, sturgis was only able to do it because he was a contractor;
<lb/>otherwise it would have cost thousands, even then. Poor Ivjr
<lb/>Sturgis; he was a nice man with seven kids, one on the way; a
<lb/>few mths after the kid was born, his wife died of leukemia, in
<lb/>the house.
<lb/>well 've rambled on long enough for today; in fact it's
<lb/>several days.after I started thisletter now, I had house guests
<lb/>and Just had no time to finish it til today, I'm sorry about
<lb/>Ken and Kathy; any chance they'll get it together again?
<lb/>will be less Irresponsible.about answering in the future.
<lb/>Note down any questions you may have about things so. you don't
<lb/>forget them when you write again. Take care and all that.

<lb/>January 25Â» 1976
<lb/>Ddar Linda;
<lb/>Tiaakns for the xmas card. You may recall that I haven't sent
<lb/>one in years, which is why youdidn't get one. I don't really
<lb/>helieve in all that holiday business any more, old grouch that I
<lb/>can be. I know it's different when there are kids around, so i
<lb/>hope your holiday season was all you wanted it to be. Mine was
<lb/>peaceful and prosperous, since there was a lot of business at the
<lb/>restaurant over the holidays; I like to receive xmas cheer in a
<lb/>tangible form.
<lb/>There's nothing startlingly new in my life lately, exc^t tha
<lb/>I'm about to realize a thirty year old dream. A friend of mine
<lb/>had recently been hit with the urge to sew; somebody gave him a
<lb/>sewing machine and he diceded to learn to use it. Apparently it's
<lb/>very simple, once you get the hang of it all. x remember how your
<lb/>mother always was sewing up Â©methingor other. Anyway, he's made me
<lb/>a nice walking coat and is in the process of doing me up a cape,
<lb/>fro ffl some nice heavy black material i found. He says it's the
<lb/>easiest thing to sew. so after three decades, l may not look like
<lb/>superman, and the material won't be laundry bag muslin, but I'll
<lb/>really look the part of someone who works in a Hungeu^ian restauran
<lb/>With my luck, somebody will come up to me and ask whether there's
<lb/>any smoking allowed in the balcony, in this city, one could wear
<lb/>anything, and not be noticed or considered strange, one of thte
<lb/>benefits of llvirg^ here.
<lb/>I hear from Lolita more than anybody else, though at xmas timi
<lb/>I do get cards from everybody. To a great extent, they're all the
<lb/>same, perhaps a bit mellowed with the passing of time. The address
<lb/>es are the asme excetp for Gr^ce, iS 1094 New York Ave, Bklyn 1120
<lb/>3. I think they'd be happy to hear from you; they always ask me
<lb/>whether I^ve heard from you. i sent Lolita those snapshots you
<lb/>sent me a while back and Gr^ce in her card to me comments on how
<lb/>much you resemble your mother. I think you should write them, and
<lb/>if you feel funny about it, it's because so much time has gone by
<lb/>since you last contacted them, it's a good contact to have, in
<lb/>particular if you're thousands of miles away so you don't have to
<lb/>see people too often. The reason I'm on good terms with everybody
<lb/>is, I think, due in large part to my not feivir^ lived in Bklyn for
<lb/>12 years. That way, I stay out of quarrels and my letters, calls
<lb/>or visits are always nice happenings, write'em, apologize, fill'em
<lb/>in on your life, and just treat them as you used to. Maybe if you
<lb/>see them someday there might be some fingerwagging about how you
<lb/>and Kenneth should have come to Nana's and victor's fuherals, but
<lb/>that'sabout it. They do always ask whether i8ve heard from you.
<lb/>.sorry about Ken and Kathy, but if something doesn't work, it'
<lb/>seSmteextBx asinine to try to patch it up and muddle through some
<lb/>how; never works, and it's terrible for the kids involved, people'
<lb/>personalities are so varied, i marvel that there are any relation
<lb/>ships lliat last. Again, kids do make a difference. I'll get a lett
<lb/>off to them each sooner or later. Tonight I'm off, so I think I'll
<lb/>try to catch up on my correspondence.
<pb n="14" facs="#page-013"/>
<lb/>speaking of people who don't write, i had a card from Enid. You
<lb/>know she's married now and living in Guayaquil ; Enid Lopez de
<lb/>Granda centeno/ 6 de marzo 4209 y R* Aviles/ Guayaquil, Ecuador.
<lb/>Her hushand, Aurelio Granda;6, is an old friend. They spent 3 mths
<lb/>in Europe last year. Malvina, w|&gt;o is 94 and startijqg to show it
<lb/>(M starting^ now lives with Olga; seems she fell and broke something
<lb/>a wfeile back and they decided, much to her disgruntlement, that she
<lb/>was too old to live alone, with nobody iHit a servant to care for
<lb/>her. You should write her too: Malvina D. Lopez, cordero 956,i^uito.
<lb/>She speaks perfect English, has a lively sense of humour, and like
<lb/>any old person, likes to get letters, she's a fuhny lady.
<lb/>Lately here the weather hasbeen anything but wintry, sunny
<lb/>days, little rain, clear skies, although in the five years I've
<lb/>been here I've seen the smog level rise considerably. I've been
<lb/>saving money and intend to find out how much land costs in the
<lb/>country areas north of here. As a waiter, l can get a Job anywhere,
<lb/>and I think I'd like to be out of the city in a few years. SF is
<lb/>still a beautiful, wonderful place, and i enjpy it still, hut the
<lb/>older I get the more i yearn for trees, ocean, fresh air, and no
<lb/>or fewer people. I'm no hermit, mind you; I'd still want to be at
<lb/>an hourfe disyanee from the cityor so, tsit away from thh hustle, the
<lb/>pollution and the crazies, the homicidal ones at any rate. Theyi;re
<lb/>worse than kidsi A friendof mine from years ago in school came to
<lb/>visit the other-day with her two daughters, aged 4 &amp; 20mths. The
<lb/>elder one was fine, but eht little one was in__to everything, pulling
<lb/>down, pus hing over, bumping into, etc etc. Fortunately, she has
<lb/>a nice personality for a little kid. Had she aimed for my harpsi
<lb/>chord, I'd have decapitated her. I really don't dislike children,
<lb/>but whenthey're at that unreasonable age when you can't talk to
<lb/>them, they d:*ive me insane. I'll never understand how Nana and joan
<lb/>did/do it,
<lb/>I haven't the energy at the moment to go into any family histor
<lb/>stories, but-I'll n^e a note of things as they occur to me in my
<lb/>meditations and send some alPng next time, suffice it to say that
<lb/>there are a lot of them worthy of recollection. Here's one; the
<lb/>very fflirst night Kana was in this country, her father, Abuelito
<lb/>(little grandfather) and Papa went to the opera to see carmen, with
<lb/>Emma calve, a great soprano of the period, French. They left Nana
<lb/>at the hotel with 5 month old victor, and she remembered hearing
<lb/>the whish-whish of the long skirts of ladies' evening gowns as
<lb/>they went down the hall, she wanted to go too, but there wasn't
<lb/>anyone to leave Victor with, she was somewhat consoled by the
<lb/>room service man who brougirb her dinner; he spoke Spanish, it was
<lb/>the Fifth Avenue Hotel, a swank place in those days, at 23rd st.
<lb/>Was torn down years ago, A few daps later they moved to a house in
<lb/>Brooklyn, someplace downtown near Atlantic Ave, Agate court, Ì ere
<lb/>your mother was born in 1901. (By that time Mamita acd Elolsa, Lola,
<lb/>etc had come, so there was somebody home and Nana cculd make it to
<lb/>the opera; she later on saw Calv^ and Caruso in carmen, and made
<lb/>up for it. so much for that anecdote.
<lb/>My best to Jim and you and the kids I've not met yet. Keep
<lb/>in touch, and i don't want the article back; it really is too
<lb/>depressing to think about how it used to be.
<lb/>love.

<lb/>Just a quick note with some sad news, namely, Halvina's
<lb/>death on March 22 at 11.45 PM, Apparently she came down with
<lb/>pneumonia and then her kidneys started failing. She was lucid
<lb/>to the end, though, and knowing Malvina, probably complained not
<lb/>about dying (after all, 96..,) but about its taking 11 days to
<lb/>do so.
<lb/>The article is a funeral oration spoken by Aurelio Granda
<lb/>Centeno, who is Enid.'s husband, and has known the family for
<lb/>decades. She was buried ir^fa plot next to Miguel's (Olga's husband
<lb/>father, who was a friend and contemporary of hers and once
<lb/>president of Lcuadoi^,
<lb/>Sic transit gloria mundi. She was thelast of Nara's gene
<lb/>ration, and just to get the record straight, she was a double-
<lb/>aunt; her father, who v/as Nana's uncle, married a widow viith
<lb/>three children, one of whom was Papa. Malvina was one of the
<lb/>fruits of this mmariage; there was a brother, Julio Cesar Lopez,
<lb/>who died of yellow fever at 18 in Guayaquil (Kana used to say
<lb/>that he died only because he wouldn't let the doctors give him
<lb/>a lavativa, a prescribed treatment at the time), and another
<lb/>sister who died in infancy. So she was Papa's half-sister and
<lb/>Nana's first cousin. She married a certain Hector Egas, who was
<lb/>something of a bum and made her life miserable for a while until
<lb/>they finally separated. He died a few years ago in Gquil; I
<lb/>remember Malvina wrote me about it and said 'Paz en su tumbaV

<lb/>October 24, 1977
<lb/>Am taking my cue from Lolita's letter about their new
<lb/>house and making a few xeroxes so-I don't have to spend all
<lb/>day typing, speedy though I am at the keys. It's been so
<lb/>long since I gave a general report that there's much to say.
<lb/>First, in the enclosed snap, you can see that I've had
<lb/>my ear pierced, a bit of folly that I did for my last birthday.
<lb/>It's not all that scandalous nor crazy, and in part reflects
<lb/>a semi-political move on my part. It's something of a gay
<lb/>fashion nowadays, and I vas so moved by the spirit of the Gay
<lb/>Lib demonstrations here last May...350,000 of us, fed up with
<lb/>being hounded and discriminated against (that awful Bryant woman
<lb/>and the like)...that the earring, in addition to being an
<lb/>adronment, is a statement. I thought it would hurt, but you
<lb/>don't feel anything. The hoop is my gala piece, reserved, with
<lb/>another little filigree heart I had a back (stud) put on, and
<lb/>v/hich was once a stickpin of Papa's, for gala occasions. The
<lb/>picture was taken in my front windows the day of the Castro St
<lb/>Fair, when we threw an open house; tnere were trioi'.B;i:icis &lt; a
<lb/>people in the street, and hundreds must have stopped up for
<lb/>wine and cheese. (Only one ear is pierced...men only wear one)
<lb/>Somewhere in the back of my mind I can hear Nana saying "Bara-
<lb/>juste" and "CarambaV which was sort of the impression I heard
<lb/>for a brief moment from Enid, who was in SF about a month ago
<lb/>for tv/o days with her husband Aurelio. Seems he' s a Rotarian,
<lb/>Guayaquil chapter, and there was some convention of Rotarians
<lb/>across the Bay in Oakland, so they took a trip, a cruise, which
<lb/>took them through the Caribbean to Curacao, thence Miami, Las
<lb/>Vegas, the south rim of the Grand Canyon and here. They were very
<lb/>rushed, so I onljy got to spend one day with them, an a Grey Line
<lb/>tour of the city they wanted to take. Unfortunately, it was also
<lb/>a very grey day, so they couldn't really see the great beauty
<lb/>of the area; they didn't even getto come over to the house,
<lb/>although the tour bus ran right by the corner on its way to
<lb/>Mission Dolores (the oldest bldg in town...1776). Castro St
<lb/>being the gay "ghetto" in SF, the bus makes a dash up the
<lb/>street to show us off to all the double-knits from loway, etc.
<lb/>Enid has gained a little weight, but isn't fat; just a bit
<lb/>plumper; a few more wrinklettes, but that happens to all of.
<lb/>(I maintain that the lines around my eyes are merely from the
<lb/>smile) She seems content. Aurelio is about Enid's height, maybe
<lb/>a little younger...Enid will be 60 next year...black hair,
<lb/>though on top I don't know; he wore a beret the whole time.
<lb/>Seems at one time he taught Spanish literature in Kansas City
<lb/>at a university; his English is good, in fact very good. He
<lb/>wanted to practice it, but I wanted to^speak Spanish(so few
<lb/>opportunities these days) so it was 70% Sp, 30 Eng. He now has
<lb/>a business in Guayaquil, a cooking oil concern. There's some
<lb/>kind of palm that produces an oil, and he has the crops and
<lb/>the factory and all that. So he's well off, which is nice. He's
<lb/>pleasant, quite a gentleman, but a bit neurotic, in that he
<pb n="17" facs="#page-016"/>
<lb/>rushes a lot and gets impatient. Ex; we had at least minutes
<lb/>to wait until the tour bus
<lb/>and it v/as coldish, but he
<lb/>it leave too soon, or they
<lb/>V.e stopped at Cliff House,
<lb/>End, and the waitress took
<lb/>was getting all nervous and
<lb/>got to the hotel, where I met them,
<lb/>wanted to wait outside for it lest
<lb/>not see it, or it get crowded, etc.
<lb/>a restaurant on the coast at Land's
<lb/>forever to bring the coffee, and he
<lb/>making Enid nervous because he was
<lb/>afraid the bus would leave, even though I mentioned that the
<lb/>driver was at the next table taking his own sweet time vlth his
<lb/>coffee. Enid said he's fussy about meals too (man after m.y own
<lb/>heart) and hates cold weather, even wearing three piece suits
<lb/>or a sweater in Guayaquil, whose average mean temperature is
<lb/>somewhat akin to that of Lagos, Nigeria, He doesn't even like
<lb/>Q,uito because he sajrs it's too cold (average mean temperature
<lb/>like_^a lovely Spring day-in Bklyn). But he s quite a gentleman
<lb/>and Enid seems quite content, which is good. She said I-Ialvina
<lb/>died very easily...a combination on pneumonia dna kidney failure;
<lb/>she spent a few days in the hospital, but at 96, what can you
<lb/>do? So she died well, with all her closest ones around her. She
<lb/>said everyone v;as fine. Byt there's another story, which I heard
<lb/>from Bea when I called to give Ulises my sympathy, I may have
<lb/>recounted all this before, I don't recall now. Anyway, it seems
<lb/>that Hector and Michita were in Hempstead with Uli and Bea,be
<lb/>cause Michita had to have a hip-bone operation which she couldn't
<lb/>really have done in Quito. It was something serious, so she was
<lb/>under semi-sedation. Anyway, just as they were about to go to
<lb/>the hospital, Hector went to the bathroom, but took the wrong
<lb/>door and took a header down the cellar stairs, fracturing his
<lb/>skull and dying Instantly. Michita dodn't realize what was goin^
<lb/>on until after the operation...no, she had already had it, that s
<lb/>it, and they v/ere getting ready to go to the airport to return -
<lb/>to Quito. Anyv/ay, Uli went with her and Hector's body to Quito,
<lb/>so he was there when Malvlna started to go under. Michita is nov/
<lb/>fine, all other things notwithstanding (For those who don't know
<lb/>or remember, Hector and Michita v/ere in Bklyn aroubb 1958, and
<lb/>are the parents of Gonzalo, Marcelo, etc.) (They were also first
<lb/>cousins, and v/ere each children of tv/o first cousins of Nana's
<lb/>on the Lopez side, which means that they were in the same genera
<lb/>tion as Carlos Guillermo, and all the Pazmino children, in short,
<lb/>2nd cousins to them, though rather older.)
<lb/>Apropos of all that kind of stuff, I've finally started to
<lb/>draw up a family tree or genealogy for you all. I'm almost done
<lb/>with the charts and will then set about putting down short bio
<lb/>graphical sketches and the like. I'm the only one who knows all
<lb/>this stuff, and it should be available in case anyone v/ants to
<lb/>know. I had a letter from Linda some time ago in which, among
<lb/>other things, she asks me about some of all this because her kids
<lb/>were asking and she didn't knov/. I'll take it up to the generatior
<lb/>of Victor through George, since,you all know the rest and can fill
<lb/>in whatever you like. I'm planning on including all the skeletons
<lb/>I know of, so you can get the poop along with the snoop. You'll
<lb/>get a copy when it's done. The style will probably be somewhat
<lb/>precious, rny only literary outlet these days outside of letters.
<lb/>Nov/, as for me, nothing really nev/. Still at the Budapest,
<pb n="18" facs="#page-017"/>
<lb/>and it's still rather slow, though enough to live on plus some
<lb/>frills. The new owner is having hack troubles, an old slipped
<lb/>disc affair which has already been operated on twice and can't
<lb/>be again, so he's been talking about closing and just renting
<lb/>the place for another restaurant. He's doing the cooking as
<lb/>well as the business end of it, and that takes a great deal of
<lb/>energy and endurance, which is catapulted into exuormous frus
<lb/>tration when we have a slov; night; the gu^'', Julius, is about
<lb/>60, has these back problems v;hich require sedation, or pain
<lb/>killers, has to work all day to get the food ready^: and then
<lb/>has slow nights. Lately only the weekends have been good. The
<lb/>food is good, better than it ever was before, but we ve never
<lb/>done much advertising l)because it costs so very ffiuch...v7e spent
<lb/>over a grabd once on radio spots and it didn't bring in much
<lb/>business. The restaurant has been there ten years and made its
<lb/>reputation mainly through word of mouth...people would come, dins
<lb/>have a good time and tell their friends, hell, by nov/ it's
<lb/>ra,ther likea faded Hollywwod star..."oh yes, I remember wonder
<lb/>v/hat she's doing novf?" Budapest best.. .great place...but without
<lb/>steady advertising, people take it for granted. If he closes,
<lb/>I get unemployment automatically, and that's enough to take care
<lb/>of me until I get something else, or sell the harpsichord I'm
<lb/>building and which is almost done. I'll send a snap of that-later
<lb/>on. This one has taken forever, but the next ones, if I continue
<lb/>this as a profession, vdll go more quickly, maybe three a year.
<lb/>There was some news a v/hile back. At least a year and a half
<lb/>ago, a woman's bag got stuck in the bus door as she got off and
<lb/>she got knocked to the pavement, in front of the Budapest. I got
<lb/>there long after it had all happened, and saw her talking to a
<lb/>couple of cops...you can imagine how much time must.have elapsed
<lb/>by that time, if the cops were there.. .anyway, that. s all I sav;,
<lb/>A couple of vreeks later a representative of the la.dy'3 lawyer
<lb/>came into the restaurant and asked whether anyone had seen any
<lb/>thing, I said no, but I did see the lady in the street. He askfd
<lb/>whether I would be willing to testify to that much, and that I d
<lb/>get paid (pl5 for being a witness. I repeated that I had nothing
<lb/>to tell, but that if they were willing to pay me ol5 fpr that,
<lb/>sure. Nothing more was heard about it and I forgot; I guess I
<lb/>thought she had settled out of court. Well, two weeks or so ago,
<lb/>I was served with a subpoena re-deposition, meaning that I had
<lb/>to go make a statement...fine (I'd forgotten about the |15| and
<lb/>could barely remember the incident at all) The day I was supposed
<lb/>to go, I had to be at the hospital, as my friend from downstairs
<lb/>had a severe electric shock v/hich shattered two bones in his
<lb/>left hand(he's better now), so when I got home I realized that
<lb/>I'd missed the app't. It was Monday the 10th, Columbus Day. So
<lb/>I,wrote the lawyer-immediately and told him my version, saying
<lb/>that I doubted it would be of any help to them, but that I v/as
<lb/>the business end of
<lb/>incident at all) The day I was supposed
<lb/>the hospital, friend from downstairs
<lb/>shock v/hich shattered two bones in his
<lb/>now), so when I got home I realized that
<lb/>It was Monday the 10th, Columbus Day. So
<lb/>.ediately and told him my version, saying
<lb/>d be of any help to them, but that I v/as
<lb/>willing to go dovm at their convenience, since I had had tib
<lb/>miss the app't, please excuse, personal emergency, k few days
<lb/>later I get this angry letter from the lawyer saying that I had
<lb/>kept a witness fee of (plS.SO, they had to pay a server ;ipl2.75
<lb/>to have the paper served, and demand is hereby made for immediate
<lb/>payment, or else they v/ould get a court order for that plus
<pb n="19" facs="#page-018"/>
<lb/>the |100 forfeiture for not shov;inc, plus the "presently unas-
<lb/>certainable damages" they had suffered because of my failure to
<lb/>appear, I called him back and asked what the hell he was talking
<lb/>about, since (remember, at this time I had forgotten all about the
<lb/>guy coming in and saying I'd get &gt;^15 for telling my story) I
<lb/>hadn't received or been offered any witness fee (he said the ser
<lb/>ver had said I requested a check...lies, and I have a witness...
<lb/>he came in, gave me the paper, and left), that as far as the 12.75
<lb/>was concerned, the paper had been served, I acknowledged that. As
<lb/>for the no-show, I agreed I \e.s at fault, but that there v/ere
<lb/>extenuating circumstances, as I had explained in my letter. He
<lb/>started to hem and te w and go on about how they had to pay a
<lb/>court stenographer, etc. I told him further that I hadn t seen
<lb/>anything, so while I was still willing to come dovm and-make an
<lb/>affidavit, I couldn't imagine how their case could have been
<lb/>damaged, ascertainably or not. This stopped him; he said that he
<lb/>v;as of the understanding that I had been an eyewitness. his back
<lb/>was up against the wall at this time...I said this wasn't true,
<lb/>that I had never claimed to have seen anything (I now- remember
<lb/>that there was a witness to that one too; the cook was with me
<lb/>when the representative first came in after the accident), that
<lb/>whfiile I was at fault for not shovdng, there was no way in the
<lb/>world that I felt responsible for any damages, and that I found
<lb/>it extortionary to demand repayment of money I'd never received;
<lb/>that his staff was extremely overzealous in trying to find witnes
<lb/>ses, that this struck me as a curious way to run a legal business,
<lb/>etc etc. He said that before he committed himself any further, he
<lb/>would have to check it out; I told him to do so, and to call me
<lb/>back, since it had taken three calls from me to get him and I was
<lb/>a busy man; furthermore, I asked for a letter from him, even if
<lb/>he did reach me by phone, with his decisions, etc. Never heard
<lb/>from him again. I m going to find out about the possibility of an
<lb/>action on my part, since he sent a copy of the letter to me, in
<lb/>which he demands immediate repayment, etc., to the plaintiff, i.e.;
<lb/>the lady; ergo, he has made untruthful statements about me in
<lb/>print to a total stranger; to date he has made no rectification
<lb/>of all this in written form, under copy to Mrs Vega; also, there's
<lb/>the obviously slipshod way he runs his business, about vrhich I'm
<lb/>going to write a letter to the bar association. As for my not -
<lb/>showing, I did write them in good faith and offered myself at theiJ
<lb/>convenience, so no judge is going to claim contempt of court on
<lb/>that one, especially with all the other details. I'll claim undue
<lb/>mental and psychological anguish, which isn't all bull because
<lb/>this whole thing happened on a Friday and I-was really pissed off
<lb/>all weekend, until 1 remembered all these details and calmed down.

<lb/>Dear Linda;
<lb/>Thanks for the letter and thoughts. As usual,
<lb/>I'm banging out an answer right away. As I always
<lb/>said, it puts the onus on the other person, but
<lb/>lately, I find that it prevents me from forgetting
<lb/>to write. I guess the California life styla has
<lb/>finally hit me after 8 years; I remember things
<lb/>that happened decades ago, but I forget to send in
<lb/>the gas bill, or to change the cat box, etc. Guess
<lb/>that's what happens when FORTY looms near. But then;
<lb/>it's^two months or so since that befell you. Can yoi
<lb/>beileve it? It goes by so quickly. People tell me,
<lb/>who have known me for years, that I look great, so
<lb/>I guess it's true; I feel great, my life goes well,
<lb/>out 1 notiee that I don't bound up the stairs as I
<lb/>used to, or that if I help a friend move on a hot
<lb/>day, I tucker out more quickly. I kee^ trim, ride
<lb/>my bike a lot, which in this city isn t always the
<lb/>easiest riding, and can still fit into clothes I
<lb/>bought ten years ago. une small annoyance; I notice
<lb/>that if I do a lot of close work, every now and thei
<lb/>I have to focus again, so I guess I'm getting a bit
<lb/>farsighted. Still have all my own teeth, though.
<lb/>Of my life; the bread and butter | still comes
<lb/>from waitering. Lately I work p/t at a posh place
<lb/>downtown that deals mainly with tourists and con
<lb/>vention people. Very easy and good money, but it's
<lb/>p/t, so I'm thinking of getting another f/t rest
<lb/>aurant Job because I want to make a bit of | and
<lb/>get some goodies. My rent is very low, and the
<lb/>place is really very nice and big, and since my
<lb/>clotheshorse days are over, living is cheap. I've
<lb/>probably said this before, but waitering is great.
<lb/>It's the easiest thing to do to make money with
<lb/>the least expenditure of Hme and effort. The Modern
<lb/>Language Ass, Just had its annual convention here
<lb/>so I Went and saw #:ome old colleagues from my
<pb n="22" facs="#page-021"/>
<lb/>teaching days. Some of them were horrified that I
<lb/>wait tables, but I felt there was a bit of enYy at my
<lb/>relative freedomj they all looked colossally bored
<lb/>and older than I, with one exception; an old friend
<lb/>and fortoer prof just changed wives after 15 years or s
<lb/>and he looks fifteen years younger. I did some teachin
<lb/>recently during a teachers' strike in the high schools
<lb/>It was fun, but it reaffirmed my decision not to teach
<lb/>any more. I think by the time Christopher and Nancy
<lb/>are our age, hlaf the country will be illiterate.
<lb/>Thanks for Kathy's address; I will drop a line.
<lb/>Always liked her. How^s Kenneth doing? Lisa got marrie
<lb/>I guess Laura wrote you. Wally and Grace called the ot
<lb/>her day; they're fine, but Wally's health isn't so
<lb/>great, though-he's still plugging along. I Â©.w them
<lb/>a year ago, and while Wally is grey and old looking,
<lb/>Grace looks the same, save for a few more grey hairs.
<lb/>Joan looks great, but drinks a bit oo much to con
<lb/>sole her woes, which pains me. I've done some cousinly
<lb/>finger wagging, but...She threw Bob out about a year
<lb/>ago, but he came back and things were patched up. Too
<lb/>bad. His health is really bad, all sorts of glandular
<lb/>troubles, mainly thyroid. Laura is now about 60, but
<lb/>Albert was, no, will be 71 in May, George and Ann will
<lb/>both be 67 this year. Grace is 70, Wally 66 I think.
<lb/>Ann wrote that George, now retired, had a prostate
<lb/>operation last year, which I guess was successful. I
<lb/>don't know, but I guess it was the same type of thing
<lb/>that killed Victor, but apparently caught in time.
<lb/>Grace and Wally said that they had had a letter
<lb/>from Minnie asking whether she could come and live wit
<lb/>them. Seems she can't get along with her own children
<lb/>in Bklyn, none of whom mnt her around. Of course it
<lb/>would be impossible, so I don't know what she'll do.
<lb/>Minnie is basically okay as aperson, but she's just
<lb/>impossible to live with, very cantankerous, bossy and
<lb/>since she's not too intelligent, unreasonable. When
<lb/>one's own-children don't want to have to take care of
<lb/>her, it says something. Her health hasn't been good,
<lb/>so I imagine she might not last toolong. Frankly, I
<lb/>honestly don't feel any obligation towards her on my
<pb n="23" facs="#page-022"/>
<lb/>part, besides which it Just isn't feasible,
<lb/>I strongly doubt that Midwood is as good as it
<lb/>was back then. That whole area of Brooklyn has come
<lb/>down enormously, and the bottom hasn't been reached
<lb/>yet. Last time I was back, I didn't see too much of
<lb/>Flatbush, but from what everybody - tells me, it would
<lb/>break your heart to see it now. In a word, and with
<lb/>out wishing to sound too racist, the whole area is
<lb/>black now, and you know what that always means. The
<lb/>kind of good, life-enhancing experiences we had by
<lb/>grcsdng up in a big city I don't think are too poss
<lb/>ible anymore; survival takes up too much time. When
<lb/>the whole city of NY can go bankrupt, it indicates
<lb/>something basically irretrievable. For someone who
<lb/>goes there newly, now, it's different; for us, who
<lb/>grew up there, things can-never be the same. Do
<lb/>you remember a kid at Midwood named Steve Solarz?
<lb/>He was in several of my classes, and was President
<lb/>of Midwood or whathaveyou, a high achiever. He's now
<lb/>a councilman or something, and making a name for
<lb/>himself. He was on tv a while back talking about
<lb/>Israel and the Palestinians, Looks good.
<lb/>How old is Casey now? I'm still working on all
<lb/>my charts and stories, but it'g bogged down at the
<lb/>moment; I will get it done, though, I was really
<lb/>gratified at the positive response I got fro m every
<lb/>body about what a few years earlier would have been
<lb/>thought of as merely another one of my eccentriel tie
<lb/>And I stiML feel the same way dDOut it; it's informa
<lb/>tion that only I posess now, and that someone some
<lb/>day will want to know, I guess I shouls also think
<lb/>ab out parcelling out all these photos and memorabi
<lb/>lia. I have nobody to leave it to here, and it's
<lb/>not as if some museum were waiting for it. Best to
<lb/>sort it out and let the various descendants have it
<lb/>all and let fate takes its course,
<lb/>I'm still building haprslchords, though that
<lb/>cottage industry hasn't taken off as splendidly as
<lb/>I hoped. I stfiill derive enormous pleasure from my
<lb/>own bad playing, and lately I've widened my horizons
<lb/>a bit via the ourchase at an auction of a Victorian
<pb n="24" facs="#page-023"/>
<lb/>parlour organ; you've probably seen them In antique
<lb/>stores. lou pump the bellows with your foot pedals.
<lb/>Granted, the tone isn't exactly that of a cathedral
<lb/>organ (Superman laundry-bag), but it allows me to
<lb/>play sustained notes and increases my repertory. I
<lb/>think it must have been in a ch0rch all these years,
<lb/>because it's been very well kept up. Wonderous to
<lb/>tell, I almost played for an Episcopal church out
<lb/>here; a friend who does it regularly was supposed to
<lb/>be out of town, and since it's a very small congregaj
<lb/>ion, I said what the hell, one Sunday morning, even
<lb/>I can get up early one day. But his trip fell through
<lb/>so my debut was postponed. Too bad, since the three
<lb/>hymns I chose were real toe-tappers. And the old
<lb/>one hundredth is great stuff.
<lb/>My current roommate is Dennis Shaw, 22, very
<lb/>sweet young man, loves the cats, and has transformed
<lb/>the back yard into a beautiful garden, not wasily
<lb/>done sincethe yard has limited sunlight. The relation
<lb/>ship is strictly platonic, though; I ve thrown in the
<lb/>towel as far as romantic invoBrements are concerned.
<lb/>Just not worth all thr trouble for me; not my style
<lb/>at all. Besides, most people are bores anyway, and
<lb/>I prefer my solitude and freedom. With my instruments
<lb/>my cats and my etectric blanket, what else do I need?
<lb/>T^e current world situation is so potentially
<lb/>disastrous; how the world has changed, and how much
<lb/>is really no different from before, but worse. I
<lb/>wonder how it willall turn out. Somebody said recent
<lb/>ly that the day of national govt's is over, that we
<lb/>hge to think in terms of a world-gov't now. Might be
<lb/>something to that, Hope we get a chance to see.
<lb/>Well, enough of all this. My best to Jim and
<lb/>the kids. Have a good 1980, and I'll be sure to stop
<lb/>on Wilmington next time I venture east.

<lb/>Deeember 2, 1962
<lb/>DÂ®ar Lindas
<lb/>I just got your letter and faithful to my oft-stated
<lb/>philosophy of ''write-when-written-to", beholdi Actually, I've
<lb/>been very bad myself about letters and keeping up, so there is
<lb/>some news to tell before I get into my stories, my life, etc.
<lb/>Did you know, did I write you, tnat Jk'ally had died? About a
<lb/>year ago, of all so rts of complications in general; water re
<lb/>tention, heart, blood pressure, what have you. In short, the
<lb/>ultimate e&amp;nsequenees of aoout 50 years of alcoholism, I didn't
<lb/>go down for the funeral; my own years of physical, if not
<lb/>spiritual separation from everybody else, haip^eft me with a
<lb/>sort of reticence about seeing people when they're dead If I
<lb/>haven't seen them while they were still alive. Some people would
<lb/>take me to tasm for that, but so what? I'm phobataly the onlv one
<lb/>who still keeps up with everybody once in a while, so,,..It s
<lb/>related, I guess, to the feeling I have of wanting to see xjlklyn
<lb/>again, but not wanting to, for the reasons I've mentioned before,
<lb/>if you do get there, which I think is a good ideaafter no matter
<lb/>how man^ years, keep in mind that the physical aspect will depres
<lb/>you. It s all black now, with all that that always means, and be
<lb/>prepared to see a lot of burnt out buildings on Ocean Ave. But
<lb/>I shan't dwell on that. I think it's a good idea to try to get
<lb/>tnere soon because, I don'^t know how much longer Albert, who is
<lb/>73 (May 8, 1909)*^ 1 think b&amp;ne cancer. It has metas-
<lb/>tesized, which means....but the last semi-incoherent letter I
<lb/>got from Laura said it seemed to bÂ® in remission, for a while.
<lb/>He also had at least one heart attack, probably a preferable way
<lb/>to go, and some sort of phlebitis. Laura's letters are hard to
<lb/>read, not just because of the handwritirig, but because she goes
<lb/>from one thing to another and you don't d.ways get the joints
<lb/>clear. G-eorge on a letter told me that Ali.is down to about 125
<lb/>lbs, but seems up, insofar as possible,
<lb/>I understand, and don't condemn, your being ashamed about
<lb/>not seeing people, but I wouldn't let that deter you from going
<lb/>to visit. Time has a way, also,-of making people forget certain
<lb/>things that may have pissed them off earlier. Remember also that
<lb/>twentytwo years have gone by, and that they would probably feel
<lb/>a little strange at first, but that would quickly pass once you
<lb/>all got over the differences in personality that have naturally
<lb/>developed over the years and got down to the basic family/race
<lb/>things that do still bind us in some ways, if they were there
<lb/>to vegin with, which I always have felt they were. Unlike, I
<lb/>add, what the relationship is between me and all my Father's
<lb/>family (-les). I've had nothing to do with any Dudleys, etc.
<lb/>in over twenty years, and they with me, and that's fine. None
<lb/>of us have anything at all in common; even my Father didn't keep
<lb/>up much towards then end, in,part because of Minnie's awful
<lb/>pefcsonality, and they acted very badlj towards him(them) at
<lb/>the end too. But that's another story.
<pb n="29" facs="#page-028"/>
<lb/>Minnie, also, by the way, is dead. -She died of old age and
<lb/>heart problems last Spring. To show you how things are in this
<lb/>life, I only found out because Lolita told me. G-eorgiann told
<lb/>her (they call eachother frequently, which I greatly applaud)
<lb/>and she wondered whether anybody had told me, which no one had,
<lb/>Mot Ann, who kept up w/Minnie; not my stepsister Mary; not nobody,
<lb/>I kept up w/Minnie by letter, and the last years of her life
<lb/>were very sad. She missed my Father very much, and had been quite
<lb/>totally rejected by her kids. None of them would have her live
<lb/>with them; nor would any of her foster children. This is, at
<lb/>least, what Minnie told me. But that's another story too, and
<lb/>for my part I'm happy the poor woman was finally relieved of the
<lb/>very heavy burden of her frustrating, lonely and unhappy life,
<lb/>Sanguinely speaking, she's better off. In a letter answering
<lb/>one from George, I mentioned that I had written Minnie but that
<lb/>the letter had come back addressee moved/no longer here, and that
<lb/>I assumed from that that she had died; I also mentioned that no
<lb/>one had mentioned the fact to me. There was a long period when I
<lb/>was getting flack for not viditing oÂ± writing Minnie, all of
<lb/>which isn't true, and was gossip started by Minnie herself. I also
<lb/>mentioned-Minnie s own commentsabout her kids, so I doubt I'll
<lb/>ever hear anything more about her or my supposed unfilial conduct.
<lb/>Miracle of miracles, hallelujah, finally....Joan left Bob,
<lb/>About 6 mths ago. She just had had it. Bhe was living in a studio
<lb/>nearby, but seemed resolved on not going back. Hope she sticks
<lb/>to it. She's 49 now (1933, October) and looks good and seems
<lb/>basically a survivor, but she drinks a lot and I worry about that.
<lb/>Some of her kids have problems, some juveMle deliquency of some
<lb/>sort(that's sort of an outdated phrase by now, I guess), and one
<lb/>of them, young Walter, has just contracted an Ann-sort of marriage
<lb/>in Joan s words. He came to visit me with one of his punky friends
<lb/>Nice kid, a bit punky himself, but you get the feeling that he's
<lb/>fundamentally good and just unavoidably keeps very bad company.
<lb/>(Avoiding that in one's kids is often a good reason for loosening
<lb/>family ties.) He &amp; his friend were a little concerned at first
<lb/>about being in the middle of the gay ghetto, and seemed to have
<lb/>some strange, mediaeval ideas about homosexuals, that we all jump
<lb/>on little boys, etc. Almost funny, as if you ran into someone who
<lb/>still thought the earth was flat. Well, he got over that, so I
<lb/>guess the visit was beneficial from a public educational viewpoint
<lb/>JOan told me by phone when she called with her news about
<lb/>leaving Bob, that Grace, who is now 72 (Oct, 1910), has been
<lb/>acting a little dotty since Wally died. Doesn't go out much, just
<lb/>stays home and drinks beer; keeps all her money(which by the way
<lb/>if enough to keep her well, with her BS too, thank heavens) in her
<lb/>checking a/c and just a little in the savings! If she goes over
<lb/>to Joan s or one of the kids' places, she's fine and has a good
<lb/>time and all that, but always insists on being driven home again
<lb/>for the night.(Everythingin Southern Cal is by car, everything)
<lb/>Never wants to spend the night at anybody's place. The last time
<lb/>I saw G &amp; W, about three years ago, she was a little fuzzy in
<lb/>general, so...All, or at least several, of the kids want her to
<lb/>live with them, but she says no. She lives ina nice little apt
<lb/>in an old folk s project (no kids), a bit cluttered with all the
<lb/>bric-a-brac they bought at garage sales (one og ghe only things
<pb n="30" facs="#page-029"/>
<lb/>for non-Valley girls to do in S Gal), but clean, safe, well kept-
<lb/>up, and close to others. 60 she at least has that aspect of one's
<lb/>wintry years taken care of. You know, they were married about 50
<lb/>years, and Wally always took carÂ© of all th@ household mattersi
<lb/>when I last saw them, they were exactly as they've always been
<lb/>towards eachother, which I think I've mentioned was predicted,
<lb/>Christopher, pay attention; Vvhen W-&amp; Grace got married, in 1932,
<lb/>or early 1933, no one knew at first. Grace told Nana one night
<lb/>on the swingat'firgt; after the initial "AvÂ© Marfa" Nana hugged
<lb/>both of them and wished them good luck, Nana told mÂ©; "Entonces
<lb/>la EiSSB cuestion era decirselo a PapaJ" - NoÂ® the thing is to tell
<lb/>Pai^al Eloisa later on shook her head and said one day that she
<lb/>didnit think it would last, Sam, Nana's brother, in case you've
<lb/>forgotten, said No way (or thÂ© current equivalent); those two
<lb/>will stay together til death them do part. HÂ© was right. The
<lb/>point of all which being that once onÂ© partner departs thÂ© scene,
<lb/>the other loses interest in life for a while, maybe forever, and
<lb/>that's when bad health sets in and one gets old and feeble. So,,.
<lb/>-By the way, happy upcoming 43rd. Ha ha. Isn't if interesting
<lb/>being middle-aged. It goes by so quickly, but it all seems fun,
<lb/>I must say, I'm content, (Now come my me-stories), doing what I
<lb/>want to, and have a lovely home which as you knov/ is always at
<lb/>your disposal. I'm still working as a waiter at SF's elegant
<lb/>Blue Fox, and no, we don't Â®rve Folger's instant coffee, in case
<lb/>you've seen that commercial, I do banquets only and it works out
<lb/>to about two or three nights a week, genarlly, though this year
<lb/>has been quite off. Occasioannly I refinslh a piece of furniture
<lb/>for someone in my shop, and I'm now working on my fo urth harpsi
<lb/>chord, All three I built have-sold, one even to the sister of a
<lb/>guy who builds happsichords, for three hundred | more than I had
<lb/>asked, which I think is something of a commercial for my abilities.
<lb/>So this is where I'm putting my energies for my future, when I'm
<lb/>too old to carry food in a tuxedo, or tiredof doing it. I've
<lb/>caused the back end of thÂ© flat to be rebuilt (started doing it
<lb/>and realized that we needed a carpenter/housewright, because of
<lb/>some fire damage from years before my landl&amp;rd bought it...all
<lb/>easier to explain when you see the place) and turned an extra
<lb/>small bedroom and back landing into a sun room/shop, where I do
<lb/>all my work. Bubbles in thÂ© ceiling and all. I collect stained
<lb/>and leaded glass pieces, and I've strated getting into orchids,
<lb/>so to speak.
<lb/>Have I ever mentioned that I've played organ in a small
<lb/>Episcopalian church twice? I was replacing their regular organist,
<lb/>my harpsichord teacher (no pedals kind of organ). It was fun,
<lb/>and they seemed to like it, and to kindly ignore the moment
<lb/>when I played a sonorous amen full organ as the congregation was
<lb/>starting the fifth and final verse of the hymn which was on thÂ©
<lb/>next page and which I didn't see. For my part I was happy to see
<lb/>that I can still blush.
<lb/>The picture of me shows you the inroads,..of time.Taken
<lb/>about six mths ago by an amateur photographer friend. When it
<lb/>was taken I still had my fourth wisdom tooth (three are left)
<lb/>and my appendix, which burst suddenly onÂ© night in June, I'd
<lb/>been feeling sort of lousy, more like food poisoning than anything
<lb/>specifically definable, until blammo, I was in bed and my first
<lb/>thought was to try not to pass out until I called my neighbour
<pb n="31" facs="#page-030"/>
<lb/>downstairs, because the pain is quite something; makes you
<lb/>dizzy. But then my roommate came home earlier than usual and
<lb/>we got into a cab, me bent over like Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, and
<lb/>up the street to the hospital, which I left ten days later in
<lb/>the pink. It was quite an interesting experience, and. made me
<lb/>think seriously about finally finishing my history. Can you
<lb/>believe that that whole appendix thing cost |9^00; With my
<lb/>Blue Shield and Medical I only had to pay |309 myself. Didn't
<lb/>your Father have appendicitis once? Around 1950 or so? Or was
<lb/>that Kenneth? As far as other physical things go, I note with
<lb/>a philosophical sigh that I'm going to have to get glasses soon,
<lb/>I find it hard to focus on things that are small, like the
<lb/>various parts of a harpsichord; reading is fine, no problem, &amp;
<lb/>for distance the accuity is still better than most. But up close
<lb/>is another thing. Farsightedness...comes with age. Bh well.
<lb/>Thanks for the photos. You've got a fine looking bunch of ki(3
<lb/>Casey must take after Jim's side, but Christopher and Nancy
<lb/>have the look all over their faces, which a studied perusal of
<lb/>the xerox-outtakes will, affirm, especially the picture of
<lb/>Estenlo and Julio câ¬sar Lopez, the former being Nana's eldest
<lb/>brother, the latter being Malvlna's brotherJand thereforÂ© Nana's
<lb/>first cousin) and papa's half-brother, probably full brother,
<lb/>but that's another story. My brush with death, as a friend called
<lb/>it, as I'Â®,yj has given me an Impetus to finish all that yarn-
<lb/>spinning, because when I go, if I haven't told it, it goes too,
<lb/>I find Christopher's interest very satisfying in this regard,
<lb/>so willy-nilly he's going to inherit the mantle of archivist,
<lb/>the "keeper of the flame" as Victor once called this particular
<lb/>mania, which, I'm sure, is, like features, genetically passed.
<lb/>Only stay to explain it, I'll put a codicil in my will stipulating
<lb/>that all the boxes of pbotos, etc., be sent to him; hopefully
<lb/>Defore that fell date I'll have it all explained away and cata
<lb/>logued somehow. (By the way, I recognize Nancy's knees too;
<lb/>you'll see what I mean in a week or two.) I'vÂ© been experimenting
<lb/>with xerography to see what the best way of reproducing some of
<lb/>tuese old photographs is; some of them come out mating people
<lb/>look like Booker T. Washington. Tnere s some grounds for the
<lb/>similarity, but not that much.
<lb/>Do youustlll^seerBarry?iIf so, please give him my regards.
<lb/>In other news, deorgiann has moved with her kids back to N. Caro
<lb/>lina, which she and the kids like. Just couldn't take B'klyn
<lb/>any more, Lolita, Tony &amp; Dennis all fine, but Lolita misses her
<lb/>friends and neighbours from E. %4th Btreet, She was born in
<lb/>1911, Incidentally, and Tony I think (don't have my records at
<lb/>hand) in 1916. Bend me Kenneth and Moose's addresses when you
<lb/>think of it. I think I have them someplace, but no telling where.
<lb/>Well, that enough (and how) for now. My best to you and
<lb/>yours, and I hope we ^et together sometime before any of the
<lb/>world s politicians and unpredictabilities blow us all to
<lb/>smithereens. Happy holidays and a great '83.
<lb/>love.

<lb/>This soupspoon once belonged to a set belonging to and commissioned
<lb/>Amalia Hurtado, made in Quito probably in the late l860's or
<lb/>early 70's of "coin*' silver, rather than the more English style
<lb/>Sterling. They eoul3 have been made after she was first widowed,
<lb/>but then she would in accordance with the etiquette of the times
<lb/>have styled herself A.H. v, d, P. (viuda - widow- of Paz y Mino);
<lb/>OR, more likeljy, she just used her own initials as did and still do
<lb/>young ladies when they pick out silverware. There were four of these
<lb/>spoons in the miscellaneous silverware collection at 2114, and I
<lb/>suppose that they were brought back by Papa in 1918, when he returned
<lb/>to Brooklyn after 5 years absence in Ecuador. I suppose they were part
<lb/>of his legacy, or just souvenirs, and that if there was any mkre of
<lb/>the set that came back with him, it waSsold at some point, perhaps to
<lb/>make the downpayment on 2114 itself. Who knows? I found them one day
<lb/>on one of my endless snoopings through drawers and bo xes in the attic
<lb/>and asked ^^ana who A H was. She told me and introduced me to her long
<lb/>departed mother-in-law/aunt in recollections, some of which I've
<lb/>mentioned in my last missive. I'm Indebted to the designation of

<lb/>the pattern was very old and traditional; indeed, one still sees it
<lb/>all over nowadays. Anyway, the four spoons were part of my legacy from
<lb/>2114, and I think they more rightly belong to you (all), who as of
<lb/>this writing are all the elder or only daughter in your lines and all
<lb/>have daughters to whom to leave them in turn, should you care to. This
<lb/>kind of stuff more correctly descends in the female line, and there's
<lb/>really no point in my keeping them just to have them in some drawer
<lb/>of my own, with me the only one who knows what they are. So here's
<lb/>teach of)your own personal family heirloom as a belated Xmas trinket.
<lb/>And of course, with it my warmest and best wishes to you all and your
<lb/>families for 1984, Maybe we'll get to see eachother this year.

<lb/>Five years later, I'm still going at it, so to make sure you
<lb/>don't think I'm unreliable as well as mad, here's some more. The pace
<lb/>should pick up a bit since although better late than never, never gets
<lb/>closer every day, particularly since people lik^^'including some I ve
<lb/>known, are going to bed with: AIDS and not gettii^ up again. Plus all
<lb/>the hazards to survival that current jjolitics seem to offer. I'm fine,
<lb/>so far healthy and happy, ; the photograph is a state of the art shot
<lb/>of my harpsichords and me, sort of srJeaks for itself. This is the in
<lb/>strument the Opera used, and I'm currently sort of rebuilding another
<lb/>smaller one for a friend. After this I might try a fortepiano. I still
<lb/>work at the Blue Fox, tend my roses, have a roommate and two cats,etc.
<lb/>And so forth.
<lb/>I'd write a longer note but there's nothing really new, which I
<lb/>suppose is the best kind of news to tell, after all. Oh, there was an
<lb/>hour documentary about Brighton Beach tonight; made me laugh.
<lb/>So, with these rambling recollections of a relative stranger re
<lb/>lative or two, I'll close sending you all my best wishes for a good
<lb/>holiday and a happy and prosperous 1984.
<lb/>I've finally fecund that

<lb/>I include the shots of Lola and

<lb/>Thursday, Sept, 18?, I986
<lb/>Linda dear;
<lb/>I've just talked, actually yesterday, with Dennis, and he seems to
<lb/>be handling it all very well. I'm still appalled by it all as a general
<lb/>concept, though, first the mother and at the same time all this with the
<lb/>father. Really quite awful. Anyway, as of yesterday, Tony is in something
<lb/>called an adult care home, where they take care of people who are physi
<lb/>cally sound and capable and continent, but just don't know what's going
<lb/>on, and so far the results are so-so, I guess he has moments of^lucidity
<lb/>and remembers and than asks "What the hell is this?" and then goes out
<lb/>again. As for Lolita's cremated remains, some plan about putting them
<lb/>with Lola someplace on LI, Dennis, whdi has power of attorney and all
<lb/>that, is undecided whether to sell their house (L &amp; T's) or keep it as
<lb/>a rental, which I advides him to do.
<lb/>He mentioned some things while we talked and I said I'd go through
<lb/>my boxes and dig out some things; he wasn't sure, for example, just
<lb/>where Lolita was born, and I knew that it had been on Staten Island,
<lb/>so I sent him soem stuff, and in the course of all that I came across
<lb/>these memorabilia, which are by rights yours, or Kenneth's, now, and
<lb/>which although the hair might strike Jfou as bizarre, it was Nana's
<lb/>doing, and very much the custom of the time. I have some for Victor
<lb/>and Alfred too, which I guessdevolve onto me. They all rather self-
<lb/>explanatory; I don't know what your Mother's illness was in 1916, but
<lb/>obviously, from the graduation picture I've sent, she got over it. It
<lb/>was probably a year late, though, and that must have rankledher, I'm
<lb/>glad 1 had the marriage announcement; I didn't remember that and it's
<lb/>pretty. I always remember the high regard and respect Nana had for your
<lb/>Father; my recollections are that of a very nice gentleman too.
<lb/>Anyway, if all this doesn't really interest you all that much, it
<lb/>should fascinate Chris, Agate Place, by the way, I think is somewhere
<lb/>down in what is now known as Bedford-Styuvessant, Most of the addresses
<lb/>they had before 2114, 443 Prsspect Place, 65 Rutland, 72 Midwood, some
<lb/>where on St John'd Place, are now, if still standing, somewhat unapproach
<lb/>able.
<lb/>The Spanish, starting from the card, says; "the 3oth of Sept 1901
<lb/>Lelia Lstala crawled for the first time",,,"the 26 of April 1901 she
<lb/>was taken outside for the first time",,.Jover),,,"(Papa s hand)the 22nd
<lb/>of November I90I my daughter Lelia Estela's first tooth appeared, at
<lb/>eight months and six days of age",,,"Jan, 29 1902 she was vaccinated",,,
<lb/>(OR innoculated against,,.?,,,hard to say),.,"the 24th of December('01)
<lb/>her second tooth came out",,,now the paper, mainly in Nana's hurried
<lb/>(uncharacteristically) hand,,,"June 7, 1902,.Stella's third tooth came
<lb/>out",,July 14, 1902, she took her first step",,,(that's nice),,.maybe
<lb/>that says the 1st of July,.,"July 4th, Alfredo Ulises went up and down
<lb/>stairs".,,"8th,,(s)he went outside",.,"11th (s)he went out in a car to
<lb/>the park",,."August 2nd (s)he went by car to Brighton",.,"25th)s(he
<lb/>went by car downtown". The (s)he could refer, verbally, in Spanish, to
<lb/>A1 or Stella, but probably refers to your Mother,
<lb/>Well, that's that for now. Best to Jim( now back?) and the kids,
<lb/>love and kisses, etc.
<lb/>Your loving eccentric.

<lb/>into the water now, Friday 11 AM. This letter stayed behind in
<lb/>order to mail it with some pictures we took the other day. We're

<lb/>We got herÂ© Sunday around 7s30 with no problems, Bie trip was about

<lb/>I remember when this letter arrived at 211it4 Nana was very upset by it
<lb/>and I think she ]mm then. Victor told me later "I don't know about StellaS
<lb/>So when Albert came over a few weeks later with the nmSf although the blow
<lb/>was stm awful I don't thinlc Nana was really surprised. By that tinÂ© Nana
<lb/>was sleeping in the living room, to avoid the stairs, and maiy nights I
<lb/>heard her crying quietly, with resignation, but with great sorrow.I don't
<lb/>think she ever got over it. She was angry, too, and often said that it was
<lb/>so unfair, that Stella had a right to many more years of life. It was a
<lb/>blow that even Nana's great stoicisra reelÂ®! flpom. But she went on.

<lb/>{ Bj'" Stella Pamino )
<lb/>The "bleal: NÂ®Tember afternoon was facing into eTening. Without,
<lb/>the silence was profound, and the cold wind "blew in sharp guste down
<lb/>the dark, narrow streets of the gloomy district. The pale light of
<lb/>the suspended lamps, shaken hy- the winds, was reflected in the dark
<lb/>stream Â©f water v/hieh flewed down the muddy streets. Torrents of rain
<lb/>fell, heating against the walls Â©f wretched houses. In the garret of
<lb/>one of these, lired a raiserahle hut honest family named Morel, con
<lb/>sisting Â©f the father, mother, and daughter. 3"^
<lb/>This sad ahode xme faintly illiomined hy a eandle s'Jistained hy twÂ©^^'
<lb/>pieces of v;ood on a little s^iuare plank. The yellow, flickering light
<lb/>hardly pierced the darkness of the garret. A door off its hinges show
<lb/>ed the way to the staircasw. The floor, of a color without a name, was
<lb/>broken in several places, showing the hearae of the room helow. During
<lb/>the flay, the garret was lighted hy a narrow Â©hlong window, made in the
<lb/>roof, and which opened and shut on a hinge. On a table, covered with
<lb/>stains of tallow, there was a jag of wator, a few cups, an empty bot
<lb/>tle of medicine, the candle, and5.^ dull, rusty knife. A small stool
<lb/>Was placed near this table. The liorels possessed biit one thin mattress
<lb/>and a piece of covering, which were devoted to the use of Madeline,
<lb/>the mother. At a little distance from the resting-place of this woman,
<lb/>was spread out a straw bed v;hieh served for the daughter Marie.
<lb/>On this dark, cold, and gusty afternoon. Morel, seated en the
<lb/>stool and Â©vereome hy v/orry, hy cold, and hy sleep, let fall on the
<lb/>table his weary head. There reigns in this garret a eold so intense,
<lb/>sÂ® penetrating that Morel, notwith-standing tl^kind of sleep into
<lb/>which he was plunged, shivered at times from head to foot. His black
<lb/>hair already showed some traces of silver. He had been a munition work
<lb/>er in a medim-size factory in Long Island. But the Workers Union had
<lb/>started a strike, and Morel, although reluctant, at last ceased labor
<lb/>and abided by the obligations of his " Union ". He brought his wife
<lb/>and daughter to New York to live, where for weeks he had sought employ
<lb/>ment in vain. Consequently, he now foimd himself in ii pitiful state,
<lb/>indeed.
<lb/>His wife had for a time taken in washing, but was finally obliged
<lb/>to suspend it on aeeount of its disastrous results on her health.
<lb/>Mario was the only hope left. She resorted, after a wide search
<lb/>for better mea.ns of maintenance, to selling newspapersâ-this was the
<lb/>only available way. With the few pennies she earned she supported the
<lb/>family as best she could. Her favorite spot was in front of St. George
<lb/>Berry, in the Battery. Marie chose this place because from there she
<lb/>could look far out Â©n the ocean, and see the fjrries coming in and
<lb/>going out. Wonderful was it to her, to v/atcli^'on dark nights, the in
<lb/>numerable lights of the boats, and their reflection on the waterl
<lb/>At night, when Marie had sold all the newspapers, she would hurry
<lb/>home where her mother and father waited for her. Then, Marie would buy
<lb/>a loaf of bread and a small bottle of milk, with the ten cents she had
<lb/>earned. And if she had a fm pennies left over, she bought a cookie,
<lb/>or perhaps an apple, to divide among them.
<lb/>One moryiing, Marie and her mother, after a sleepless night, were
<lb/>up at five'*belÂ©ck. Cold, himger, and sickness had kept their eyes wide
<lb/>open, Marie, after arranging the room, started out to earn her familys
<lb/>broad. It waÂ« a bitter cold morning, and the winds brought with them
<lb/>clouds 89 sombre, and a rain so penetrating that Marie was ready to
<lb/>perish with eold. Reaching the Battery, she piled her newspapers neav-
<pb n="40" facs="#page-039"/>
<lb/>ly on a v/ooden-'box she foimd on a corner. Har aoney-hox, which her
<lb/>father had taiken such pains and so much time to make, she placed on
<lb/>top of the papers to keep thera from blowing avmy. Then, MarJ.e,. sat com
<lb/>fortably on the indifferent curbstone, and wrapping her olC^'gray man
<lb/>tle aroimd her and trying to forget the cold which nipped her without
<lb/>and the unsatisfactory hmger which gnawed her within, delirered her
<lb/>self up to the employxaent of watching and thinking.
<lb/>Presently, three ill-dressed boys appeared with their hands btirieot
<lb/>in their pockets. Seeing Marie, the wooden-box, and the money-box, they
<lb/>smiled wickedly at on# another. Then, the tallest purposely coughed sÂ®|
<lb/>as to be heard by Marie. Hearing the sound right behind her, she turnecji
<lb/>The boys looked at her with an insolent and jeering air. And then,like
<lb/>a flash, onÂ© seised the newspapers and flusll^them near and far. Anothor
<lb/>dashed the wooden-hex against a stone wall, until it was in splinters,
<lb/>while a third, first broke the money-box and then flung it on the ear-
<lb/>tracks. A passing car finished the work started by the ewil boy.
<lb/>The next day at six oclock, Marie stood, contrary to cugtom, on
<lb/>the next corner from St. George Perry. The reason for this change is
<lb/>well-known, no doiibt. The streets were thronged 7/ith men, women, and
<lb/>children, all bustling to and fro.
<lb/>Suddenly, a fierce wind turned the corner, taking with it the
<lb/>newspapers of Marie. She uttered a cry^&amp;m ran to the middle of the
<lb/>street after them, when----- something struck harâ--- but Marie did
<lb/>not know what, for the next minute she lost all consciousness.
<lb/>The next thing Marie remembered was, waking up 'with the feeling
<lb/>as if she had had a frightful nightmare. She heard roices, too, speak
<lb/>ing in a hollow sound, and as if mioffled by a rush of vxind or water,
<lb/>soon she became aware that someone was handling her; lifting her up
<lb/>and supporting her . In a sitting-jras'-ture. .
<lb/>In flTÂ© minutes more, the cloud of bewilderment djssolfad. Marie
<lb/>knew quite well that she was not in her cold strav/ at home. Instead
<lb/>she saw that she was in a warm couch, and also that hers v/as not th8_
<lb/>only one in the room, for there were two rows of them, one on each Ì ide
<lb/>Mirle scrutinised the face of the physician who hold her. He had tnicx
<lb/>black hair, a straigiit nose, brilliant far-apart ayes, and a rather
<lb/>large mouth. Although she was Tsry feeble, Marie heard a'clock stfSkÂ®
<lb/>tY/-elya P. M, She looked about her and saw her terrified father and
<lb/>aether at the foot of the bed, to which the mother elung for support.
<lb/>A group of trim nurses were gathered on the other side of the bed.
<lb/>As MarlÂ© stared at the ssiai-elrclÂ® formed around her, a tail gsntU
<lb/>man, introducing hii^eif as Mr Harsen, gaxe her iiis hand. She took it.
<lb/>Then, Merel and his wife approached their daughter and tenderly caress-
<lb/>Marie, then, asked what had happened to her. She was informed
<lb/>that Harsen, who was a millionaire, while riding in his automobi^
<lb/>had seen her in the middle of the street, that he had given the wammg
<lb/>but it was too late, and that har lag had bean injured, but that it
<lb/>would be better in a few Yireeks, ^ n j *
<lb/>Three weeks later, Marie, thougii still quite weax, 'was allowed to
<lb/>go home. Asoompanied by a nurse, she wsas taken in a closed coach,
<lb/>looking out of tha window, Marie noticed that they ware on the road
<lb/>leading tÂ© the country and not to her home. She called the attention
<lb/>of the nurse to this fact. Hearing this, she (the nurse) told the
<lb/>coachman the same. Ho simply replied that such were the orders of Mr.
<lb/>Harsen, and that ho was all obedience. Maria, forced to be content
<lb/>with this answer, toon fell asleap- ^ ^
<lb/>At the end of half an hour, the coach stopped. Mane awoke and
<pb n="41" facs="#page-040"/>
<lb/>raised her head. She foiand herself on the top of a hill; what was her
<lb/>astonishment; her amazoraonti A pretty Tillage huilt on the hillside
<lb/>and surrounded "by chestnut-trees* closehj'- a streamlet; a "beautiful
<lb/>farm at the end of the Tillage; an orchard on one side of the house;
<lb/>on the other, a pretty garden filled with flowerÂ®; a church la the dis
<lb/>tance-âall this was "before her eyes.
<lb/>At the door of the farm, Maries father and mother came to meet hsT.
<lb/>She ran to them and asked what it all meant. The mother was in tears,
<lb/>and 80 the father told her that ?ir. Harsen, hearing of their dreadful
<lb/>cireuastanees, had made them a present of the farm, and also of a large
<lb/>sum of money. Marie stared at her father, dazed. It seemed to her al
<lb/>most supernatural. She was then led into the house.
<lb/>The kitchen displayed the most cheering sight. On the "black hearth
<lb/>"blazed immense logs of oak. This immense fire sent aÂ® much light as
<lb/>heat to all parts of the kitchen. Large kettles and saucepans, of red
<lb/>copper, v/are arranged on shelTes, shining like silTer, A large table
<lb/>occupied the center of the room. In the middle of this table, a large
<lb/>tureen, filled with Tegatable soup, smoked like a crater, and coTered
<lb/>with its fumes a formidable plate Â©f ham and eabbage, and another
<lb/>plate, not less formidable, of mutton and potatoes* A roast Teal,
<lb/>flanked by two cheeses and accompanied by tv^o salads, completed the
<lb/>sight tmfolded by the table. Three or four stone pitchers, filled with
<lb/>foaming cider laada on the farm, and as many loaTes of bread, as large
<lb/>as millstones, were arranged on lew shelres.
<lb/>Maries room was large and with four windows. A gray paper, with
<lb/>bunches of green flowers, coTered-the walls. The floor shone like a
<lb/>mirror. Curtains of gray and green chintz wore suspended from the win
<lb/>dows sjtd bod, which last was eoTered^with a eeunterplane of the same
<lb/>material. On a stone mantel-piece could be seen two flov/er-pots, paint
<lb/>ed a fine emerald green.
<lb/>Marie and her family liTed Tery happily on the farm. Later, the
<lb/>daughter fotmd a satisfactory position in the city, and with what she
<lb/>earned and with what Mr. Harsen had giTen them, thej^ neTer knew the
<lb/>word " PoTarty " again.
<lb/>The end.

<lb/>(My typing ain't what it once was.) July 18, 1988
<lb/>Dear Bob:
<lb/>I was very glad to get your letter today; it has indeed been a long time, and I
<lb/>hope we don't have to let quite so much time go by between communications any more,
<lb/>if for no other reason thai that the letters won't have to be too long. There's so
<lb/>much to catch up upon after what must now be about 20 years at least, bliere to begin?
<lb/>Foist, all my lox-'e to you, Wanda, David &amp; Rebeckah (I've never seen that spelling);
<lb/>I think I have a snapshot of you, Wanda &amp; David when he was a tot. Seems strange that
<lb/>you should now be/belling me that he's interested in a career in teaching vSpanishJ
<lb/>It's also strange for me, haihlng just turned ItB, to remember that a mth ago you hit i|0,
<lb/>Whodathunkit? Where indeed 1 o begin? I suppose with theenslosed memorabilia.
<lb/>I don't l&lt;noB whether you got the jcmas shot some years ago vrhen I sent it out to
<lb/>all of youse as my xmas card. A letter I sent you after your Father died was returned;
<lb/>I enclose it unopened, since I'm sure that what I must have said then still holds and I
<lb/>couldn't improve on it. I loved Albert very much, I always felt the sentiment was more
<lb/>than mutual, and I recall so many reallj^ laugh-filled moments of his, that irrepressible
<lb/>laugh and those one-liners, those withering but good-natured putdovms,....One anecdote:
<lb/>when Hector &amp; Michiita visited I'iY and a i-jhoile bunch were over at your place on the lith
<lb/>floor 3jn the l/r...I went to get something from the Icitchen and ksKprE bumped my head
<lb/>loudly on a kitchen cabinet. Someone yelled in What happened? and I answered. Yoru Father
<lb/>said "You didn't breal the cabinet, did you?'.' The last time I spoke with hJLm he
<lb/>was clearly not feeling h-is best, but the same spirit was there and we sort of said a
<lb/>bittersweet but laughing So long, because felt that this was probably the last chat.
<lb/>I remember witing to someone after Lolita died (Now that was a double dutch summerI)
<lb/>that A1 &amp; Lolita were probably someplace laughing like loonies and smoking like chimnej^'E,
<lb/>looking at the rest of us and having a swell time. (I may liave said that in the enclosed
<lb/>unopened. If so, forgive the repetition d just attribute it to the tiresome magniloquence
<lb/>and prolixness that seem lately to characterize ngr every utterance. All innate traits
<lb/>get stronger with age.) Vliich brings me to the splendid likeness of me. A friend took
<lb/>some shots of a harpsichord for me so I could usethem in an advertising flyer. He took a
<lb/>couple of me, so you're the first to see just what it all looks like as of July 7j '88.
<lb/>I found a developing sale that gave dups, so here's one. By innate traits 1 obviously
<lb/>refer to the gradual uncovering of the unique Pasmino forehead, of which I hear you're
<lb/>aware. Thoi; dost not pine in. solitude, though I mil confess that for a year or so I've
<lb/>been shaving the front; there Xirere several recalcitrants x-fho refused to fall out and
<lb/>thereby made any attractive combing impossible. By increasing my daily shaving square-
<lb/>inchage, I improved the general impression. ( I admit to being appalled tliat several
<lb/>friends didn't notice, but thj^ought I'd liad a liaircut. Fools. I thought it was a huge
<lb/>difference.) By it ( the foto) you'll have the nost recent evidence of my so far

<lb/>and I'm sure she'll enjoy looking for resemblances with 3/our kids. Another anecdote
<lb/>that for sime ine&gt;5)licable reasom just hit me: I was the first and sole vritness of
<lb/>your first steps] Mist have been the summer of 'ii9. Laura Lou &amp; your Mother were in
<lb/>the Icitchen (2111i) with Nana, and I I'las on the proch watching you play on the front
<lb/>latm. There was a blanket on the grass and you were sitting there in the sun playing
<lb/>with whatever toy you could put in your mouth. You had beeai crawling fsmr for some
<lb/>mths. Then I looked up^ I guess from a comic, and saw you bend over, sjiand up, and
<lb/>totter off the blanket onto the grass. You stopped, because I called you, and looked at
<lb/>me, I went in and called them but to see, but you had sat dot-m on the grass and nothing
<lb/>could coax you into a repeat performance. But they knew it was true because you were
<lb/>some distance from the blanket, Basta. I'm gratified by David's interest jn Spanish,
<lb/>as I am by yours and the upcoming efforts in amelioration of those abilities. So much to
<lb/>say. Foist, for sorre future letter, I'd advise against it. Lots of reasons, mainly
<lb/>boi5.ing downi to.. .teaching isn't worth it, and if he follows m;/ steps, whic?i seems likely,
<lb/>he'll be good at it and enjoy it for a while, and it will certainly be a great impetus
<lb/>towards his finding out about who he is, but it iirill ultimately shrivel his soul to
<lb/>try tm ijipatt it to kids who are probably nowadays even more illiterate and distinetested
<lb/>thai they were in my days as a college Spanish teacher, PhD candidate at Harvard, and
<lb/>all that other mountajnous bullshit that the academic world embodies. If you're good at
<lb/>something, you'll just love it. The things you love are for you, and OI-TLY those who
<lb/>can love them as you do, I've knoâ t^^l too many academic rrarriages among friends of mine to
<lb/>doubt that the teaching experience ends up in anjMhing that doesn't closely resemble
<lb/>Virgina Â¥oolf. If hei-ants to teach, aim him at ESL. That is truly worthy work. Or even
<lb/>more so, especially now, teaching literacy. That s a thought to chew on. I feel, given
<lb/>ID!' experience, and I'm no fool,...eccentric, but no fool...vox. populi, vox Dei, and all
<lb/>that. I'd like to be able to talk to hdmabout it, should he care, or you care, to i-rritc.
<lb/>Maybe I could impart some unconventional insights re Academe. After all, I've been.
<lb/>I gaess that brings me to your paper, for which many thanks. In your letter you say:
<lb/>"There have been manj' times"I have thought about you remembering your encouragements to
<lb/>speak correctly and etc etCo" So, dear cuz y herinanito, I shall. Some time back, I came
<lb/>across a carbon of a term paper I had &gt;rritten for a class at Farvarrrrrrd on an Argentinina
<lb/>author named Bioy Casares. This was years after I had stopped any sort of academic
<lb/>puEsuits. It was in elegant, academic Spanish and got an A from Anderson-Imbert, who^i I
<lb/>only mention to honor him as one of the ^reat teachers of the age, in Latin American Lit,
<lb/>It was as if I were reading some student s term paper. A very good one, but like another
<lb/>person. A totally different persona had 'vrritten that than was reading it now. The ideas &amp;
<lb/>developments were unassailable, but who cardd? I wondered whether some of what I said
<lb/>was this or that had ever entered the mind of the author? It went into som.ewhat abstract
<lb/>(.â onclusions, which is what I felt in your paper. Granted, the subject material is
<lb/>alien to me, and the motivations to make the points unclear. I understood it better by
<lb/>reading the resumen in Spanish thai by reading it in English. I guess what I'm trying to sb
<lb/>is that it lacks conciseness. There are too m.any ideas: this could have been tifo articles.
<lb/>It's writing to other academi.cs, and that only reaches academics, or maybe could only
<lb/>be published in academic periodicals, and ultimately that s only good for getting a
<lb/>better job at some equally tiresome but more prestigious, perhaps, institution. You have
<lb/>a irdssionaiy zeal i3i youj you've chosen, honourably, a religious ambience jjn wiiich to
<lb/>exert this force which is ultimately the same force as the teaching ambition. To improve
<lb/>the spirit of mankind. If you write something that is impenetrable for the average man,
<lb/>that's a thought not commuriicated, an argument not preferred, (sp?) To the average
<lb/>reader directed, even in a scholarly periodical, concise, succinct, presented with a
<lb/>logic that intimidates refutation hastily illconceived, that makes only enough points
<lb/>for the reader to digest...he ahf la meta. Y basta. But I congratulate you on the
<lb/>book and its dedication. Non omnis moriar. I have to remind you, to assuage perhaps
<lb/>the outrage, perhaps, outrage, that I was also an editor for Houghton-Tlifflin and I've
<lb/>hacis tons of experience in telling people that their mn^iting was this or that, and I got
<lb/>paid for it. So, otra vez, querido, I'm just telling you what I thought, and I hope I've
<lb/>said something you've also thought,
<lb/>(You see, if the verbosity was bad years ago, now )
<pb n="44" facs="#page-043"/>
<lb/>As for Ecuador, la cuna, and all that, the last time I heard from anyone was about
<lb/>12 yrs ago when Enid &amp; her husband, Aurello, passed through SF on a tour with thÂ®
<lb/>Rotaries, or Kiwanis,, ,Rotaries think. .Aurelio.. .and unfortunately it was a very
<lb/>i"oggy day, and the bus tour we took failed to show them just how beautiful this area
<lb/>is. Apropos, I'm sorry it didn't work out for youse (Never said that, but it replaces
<lb/>Ustedes maivelously.) to come look-see out here. This is a wonderful place to live.
<lb/>The climate is just wtat heaven is supposed to be like, and the beauty of the land, the
<lb/>indescribable lovliness of some of the weather...this is REALLY where it's at. So if
<lb/>the academic fame brings to your hands a possibility to move not here with a job in
<lb/>what you want to do, take it. It rejuvenates, AngA'/ay, in another excess of verbosity
<lb/>during that visit, which coincided with the big Gay Day Parade etc., 1 felt it imciunPcnt
<lb/>upon me to just say in writing to her, she could tell Aurelio if it mattered, that I was
<lb/>gay, and thatws fine and 1 hoped it was with them too. haven't heard, a word since. 1
<lb/>v/rote it all in a nice letter to Enid andrnve it to her sayi:ig read it alone. It was a
<lb/>time irj one s spiritual growth when openness was required; silly, in some cases, since
<lb/>it dealt with telling people irrevocably but honestly, what one was all about^ because
<lb/>that could someday help to unravel all the pernicious and censurable lies still being
<lb/>promulgated by the peipetuators of obsurantism. Well, haven't heard a word since. I dread
<lb/>thinking that that in and of itself was enough to make a terrible correspondent, Enid,
<lb/>stop writing, which she nearer did muvh of anjnray. After an earthquake I read about in
<lb/>the paper, in Ecuador,, in Guayaquil where Enid lives(d?), 1 wrote a lifter asking how

<lb/>July 2h, 1988
<lb/>Dear Bob:
<lb/>I hope I didn't put you off by anything in mj'- last barrage. There were a lot
<lb/>of ideas in it as there are in j'^our paper, which I've just reread. I've also reread
<lb/>my letter to you, and thought I'd come up with some more concrete examples of what
<lb/>I xjas referring to, for whatever they might be worth. First, interras of jargon
<lb/>and communication, a couple of sentences Xirhose meaning is, to me, very difficult
<lb/>to get: p. 30 "Both the historical and sociological studies of general and religious
<lb/>education have revealed various models of education which have functionally emerged
<lb/>and have been pei-petuated in education'.' Tliree uses oi "education" in the same
<lb/>sentence. A bit farther on, and continuing onto p. 31: "Wiereas the explicit
<lb/>curriculum may expxssk affirm a multicultural education, the hidden and null
<lb/>curricula may operate effectively to undermine that euphasis. This is too common
<lb/>an experience for ethnic groups tkaÂ± who ocperienee the wide gap between what L C
<lb/>has termed the stated intentions of the explicit curriculum and the revealed
<lb/>preferences of the hidden and null curricula'.' Sranted, these are terms with
<lb/>meaning to the specialist, but nonetheless they strike me as a bit obfuscating.
<lb/>That s a peril in jorunal writing, but it could be minimized somewhat. I also take
<lb/>personal exception to a couple of current usages of nouns as verbs, forecample,
<lb/>p. 28: (10 lines from bottom)"an inability to impact upon that socioty etc'i And
<lb/>on p. 35: "The resurrected and exalted Christ at Pentecost gifted his followers etc'j
<lb/>Details. But sometimes the small details stand out as large as a mustache on
<lb/>the Mona Lisa. Now then, let me share some observations on some of the ideas &amp;
<lb/>terms.
<lb/>I've never really understood, in my own life experiences, just what people
<lb/>mean sometimes when they say "racist'.' I think to some extent the word is a mmsnomer.
<lb/>It hides behind the external of race the real basis of the dislike, wrhich is
<lb/>cultural. One identifies the cultural trait, real or perceived, with the color
<lb/>of the perpetrator of this or that trait. It varies of course according to the
<lb/>group, minority, if you wish, with which one is most familiar. If one cites the KKK
<lb/>lynching a black person, that's racist, because it's specifica3.1y against blacks.
<lb/>But if the ordinary person(of any color) talks of these damn niggers, spies, chinks,
<lb/>flips, etc etc., or even these damn honkies, it's something in their culture, not
<lb/>iheir tint, that's the annoyance. I think it s too simple to just bundle all these
<lb/>aspects into that one term, which so many people do. Anti-Semdtic is another one;
<lb/>we all 1-cnow how that s defined, but it is also true that anj-dme a Jew makes a
<lb/>disparaging remark about a Palestinian, that is equally anti-Semitic. I've heard
<lb/>Zionists refer to non-Zionist Jews as anti-'-ernites. That s really silly. And if
<lb/>one talks, in America, of being anti-Je&gt;/ish, one really means anti-Ashlcenazi,
<lb/>since in this country that's what we understand as Jewishj we have no loiowledge of
<lb/>Sephardic, levantine, Yemeni, etc Jews. So one always falls into the pits of
<lb/>semantic vagueness. It only underscores how little these terms mean, and how
<lb/>little one has really thought about just what itis one dislikes about this or
<lb/>that group. You say on p. 2? something about our extended fanily ties in a
<lb/>world of an Anglo dominant local comraunity. Our Brooklyn community of them times
<lb/>T-ras overvjhelmingly JevTish; it would have been verj'- different if we had groam up
<lb/>in. a predorninant,ly Irish or Italian area, but it was Jewish. So what does Anglo
<lb/>mean in this context? Now, as to just what jcet we are, you and I, since we
<lb/>both have the same degree of it, in my case on my mother s side. (Final Anglo
<lb/>thought; 2620 was, to my knoi^rledge, with the exception of Carrie a nd ''Irs Petrocovia,
<lb/>on the 1st floor, Jewish; No, Firs Perrina. Is that the same Anglo as the population
<lb/>of a smal.1 Southern to^m?) Mispanic-North American. Yes, that ok. I like it
<lb/>better than Latino, ILispan:c, Chicano. But is there really airgthing intrinsic,
<pb n="46" facs="#page-045"/>
<lb/>anj'thing Immediately identifiable about us that fits that? Could anyone know that
<lb/>we had anj'thing Latin about us unless we told them? No. Yes, you add the tilde^
<lb/>but outside of that the name could be Italian or Greek. And it's an identity, or
<lb/>an identifier, that vie chose over, say, Irish-North American or Pennsylvania
<lb/>Efutch-Morth American. If Nana &amp; Papa had died together in 1920, for example, our
<lb/>parents and we would have had no inkling of being "LatinU And in a larger sense,
<lb/>we aren't Latino; we're the 2nd generation born here. There was really almost
<lb/>nothing about our background that anyone thought of as being Latin, Ì sing the
<lb/>term as it used novxadays. Our latin community was the family, and even more
<lb/>specifically, Nana, Lola &amp; Eloisa (Enid too, I guess). There were no other
<lb/>"Latins" in. our upbringi.ng, ie there was no fee.ljng of participation in a Latin
<lb/>"comnunity'J I hate the wmird community used thusly, in any group. Meaningless.
<lb/>I wouldn't say that anyone ever tried to "pass"; physically, we could have, but
<lb/>if it could be said about any of \is, one would have to say that from time to time,
<lb/>whenever a relative visited from Ecuador, we, those cf us &gt;iio spoke Spanish, tried
<lb/>to pass as Latins to them. Nana and the rest already knew English when they came
<lb/>to NY; Spanish was of course the house language for our parents' generation, but
<lb/>the older siblings spoke it better than the yomger, with the exception of George,
<lb/>who, like I did, took it in school. Grace alxrays answered Nana in English, and
<lb/>even your sainted Father had a strong English accent when he spoke Spanish, and I
<lb/>doubt that Grace or your Father ever read, or could have read with ease, in Spanish.
<lb/>I only learned it because I wanted to, starting at age 12; since I was l.iving
<lb/>where it was spoken, when I learned it I had almost no accent. It still astonishes
<lb/>real Latins that I meet in the course of my social and professional (xraiter) life
<lb/>that I speak it so x-xell. They always ask where I'm f rom, or assume because I'm
<lb/>white that I'm Cliil^ an or Argentinian (never Spanish, since I don't have that
<lb/>accent). You feel yourself to be an adopted Puerto Pican; fine. I can see that.
<lb/>But you're not really Puerto Rican. If anything, you'd be an adoptive Neyorican.
<lb/>I, who am far more familiar with aspects of the Latino culture, wrho have read it,
<lb/>been there, etc etc., I'm nit Latin. Or at least that^s not the foundation of my
<lb/>character thiat I feel is foremost in my makeup. Latino really should be used to
<lb/>describe someone who was born there, wrhose native language n.'as Spanish, who is
<lb/>Catholic y que tiene tipo latino. That ain't us. "dien latinos ash me "Do nonds es

<lb/>butler/foctrian work around the house, which at the time was 'udwood St, just off
<lb/>Fiat.bush, in what was then really an "Aiiglo" neighbourhood. Celsn was a zambo,

<lb/>reference to the racial misture of s Oiiieone, one is specific, irgnvay, one day an
<lb/>old black man who was a sei-^rant for some neighbours asked Abuelito, referring
<lb/>to Gelso, "Tour man, what is he? He's not like me, is He?" Or words to that
<lb/>effect. The "Latin" type just wasn't seen in hlYC until riTuch later. In fact, Nana
<lb/>used to mention that it xras very strange fot her, latina from a very social
<lb/>society, that she had no latin friends. That s wrhy I s ay, cur Latin culture
<lb/>never existed; it was the family. And there was another even stronger difference
<lb/>between us and the Latsns in the US today in that we vreren't Catholic. That
<lb/>story is alreaciy well knoujn; but it can't fail to be clear to you that being ac
<lb/>tively Catholic is one of the criteria for being latinoto most people, and is
<lb/>perhaps the basis for much hatred, which again wouldn't be racist but sectai'ian.
<lb/>i-iamita went to church, and Lola I think towards the end, but J'^'ana, Victor, etc.
<lb/>^'^ever. Then Papa died in Ipljit the funeral directors a sked wliat tjgDe of religious
<lb/>service the family wanted and Victor, speaking for everyone, said none, that his
<lb/>Father wasn't a religious man. The agent said "Veil, we really have to give the
<lb/>gentleman some sort of send-off" so Kana &amp; Victor decided on Unitarian, in the
<lb/>opinion that that group wras the least offensive to family sensibilities. Nowadays,
<lb/>it wrouldn't matter so much, but back then.. .I'm sure Vanda has had insights as
<lb/>to the seeming contradictions of being a non-Catholic latina. By ten way, you
<lb/>should not be surprised if being a Baptist clerg;/manraises an eyebrow among local
<lb/>populations dovjn there. There are evangelicals, but the dominant population is
<lb/>firmly Catholic and hence rather intolerant.
<lb/>On p. 20, end of penultimate paragraph:"the perspective of the Christian faith'.'
<lb/>lliich one? I assume Apuntes is a Baptist pericdical. "wt so many sects call them
<lb/>selves Cnristian, confusion could arise. I suppose it wrould be nice if thej^ could
<lb/>all get together, but that s not likelj'-, and the Christians I encounter tend to
<lb/>be very particular about not being confused writh those otrier guys. (Yes, I do
<lb/>encounter them.) On Page 31; that jerk y^-u mention liappened to be anti-Spanish,
<lb/>but 3J1 that area he could just hs easil.y been anti-French becaise he hated Canucks.
<lb/>I think I've really never miet anyone I considered as truly free from some sort of
<lb/>seemingly irrational dislike of some group. No one. And I don't always think their
<lb/>utterances are tisat uirreasoiiable. I suppose it has to do with wisich ones I shareo

<lb/>Itcan calloachother queens, but no one else s as if there is a tacit

<lb/>it s advisable because one ha.s to coirjTiunicate and one should, for one's ora
<lb/>good, know the rudiments at least of the national tongue. I really don't think
<lb/>one s cultural heritage can be that easily discarded of one wants to hold on to
<lb/>it, I have a real problem with voti-ng, though, becaise as a native member of a
<lb/>very worthxi?hile and all too oppressed minority, now struggling against a double
<lb/>burden, I find it offensive in the extreme that someone from X can come here with
<lb/>a set of moral precepts more suited to the middle ages and try to tell me that
<lb/>I'm not suited to teach their kids, or do this or that, or that I don't have a
<lb/>right because someone makes a nasty remark, or get angrj/' becase some gays get
<lb/>beat up just because they're gay, or tl-iat these sam.e ignoramuses perpetuate mis

<lb/>chooses from what one knows or has discovered about one's backgromd or some
<lb/>part of it to broadcast to the world as the essential. ME. Others ma;/ not see you
<lb/>the same way. I guess it gets down to is there anything in your "ethnic" back

<lb/>you even try? And can that ever be taught? How can one teach cuHural heritage?
<lb/>It s like sex education; it should be done at home. The final arbiter of the

<lb/>It must be remembered that for ancient Hebrews, to hear /iramaic spoken
<lb/>in Jerusalem was akin to hearing the|thickest black English variety spoken on
<lb/>the steps of the '^apitol bldg. There s a wonderful scene In "The Life of Brian"
<lb/>by Monty Python where Pontius i^ilate"addresses a crowd &gt;rith an accent like Elmer
<lb/>Fudd, and another Roman talks wj.th a lisp. Made people laugh. Maks people aiigry
<lb/>if you say unpopular things in that same tongue. I think ^so thiat I fail to
<lb/>be convinced, after all, logically, by the jump you make between the educational/
<lb/>cultural stuff in. the body of the paper and the relation or parable you wish to
<lb/>draw mth Jesus &amp; Galilee, I see the historical Jesus as an ideologue, not a
<lb/>sociologue, a questor after spiritual teachings (witness his wanderings to the Far
<lb/>Orient during those missing years) rather thari someone who was concerned with the
<lb/>demographic realities of the time. His "cultural" heritage was probab?i.y looked
<lb/>dot/fTi on by southeimi Hebrews as ruch as his theology was contested. J wonder wliat
<lb/>he d think if he could see what's going on in Galilee nowadaysJ

<lb/>Dear Bob:
<lb/>I was very happy to get your letter this morning^ both to find out detaiH-S
<lb/>of the trip,and to see that my earlier missives hadn't coinpletely estranged us.
<lb/>Made rae feel good. I'm glad that Aida went along; it must have really been
<lb/>wonderful for her to again be in a p'^ace id-ere everybody sp-eaks Spanish, even
<lb/>though the accent is ditferenrb, SOOOOO different, ps. I'm sure you, kbiida and I
<lb/>can have some laughs on that score, ps. Even though you didn't speak Spanish while
<lb/>Naria, Lola &amp; Eloisa wers still around, you heard it, and you probably noticed the
<lb/>difference. Had you gone to Guayaquil, it would have sounded even odder, perhaps.
<lb/>Befoi^e I gorget, let me send un estrechisimo abrazo to Aida when you speak to her.
<lb/>I always recall her fondly. Wanda had a brother I think, Omar or Oscar; I hope he
<lb/>is also well.
<lb/>Isn't Quito lovely? That exhilaration of altitude, the beauty of the colors
<lb/>on the patchwork quilts of the farmlands nearby, those pregnant and almost lubricious
<lb/>clouds, and el Pichincha, and the smell of eucaiiyptus(which you'll also smell here)
<lb/>and the smoke of fireplaces, and that lovely area arcimd Sangolqui and Conocoto...
<lb/>when I first visited in 59, it was such a overvrhelming esqjerience of the beauty of
<lb/>the Earth, I'm sure you felt that too, and maybe something of whl. I did at times
<lb/>when Enid or Olga and 'liguel would take me to some place that Nana had told m.e of,
<lb/>or meet people she knew. We'll have to talk long abnut whom you met and how they're
<lb/>doiig. Although I've liad no contact xoith anybody there since Enid and Aurelio passed
<lb/>ttoough here, must be ten years ago or more, I do often wonder hoxj the;/'re doing,
<lb/>on.d which ones are still alive. So many times while I was there, it felt like h opib,
<lb/>another hom.e, something in the genes of our forbears, som.e of whom were there for
<lb/>centuries, and some for milennia, which called up to m.e memories of other lifetimes
<lb/>almost...1 felt as if 1 were rexperiencing things. It was strange. In short, a
<lb/>lovely place, nice to have been there, but a bit too provmncial for lifestyles not
<lb/>germane to the locale. Last tim.e 1 vrent, in 69, it was vrith a lover of imme namied
<lb/>Jimmy, whom they seemed all to like. Enid especially thought he was very funny and
<lb/>always made lier laugh,
<lb/>I'm glad to read about the impending stay of Juan Carlos, in part because of the
<lb/>felicitous name (ycu Icnow I've always been a monarchist) and mainly becajse 1 revel
<lb/>3ri this retjcing of l.oose family strands after so much tirae and ssparat3.on. I knoxfl"
<lb/>"'ana would be just tickled pink to ]&lt;now that hxexb another of her grandsons was
<lb/>establ.ishing coritact with the grandchildren and great-grahdchildren of her brother
<lb/>Miguel, It really is rather reniarkable, after all. They came ili 1900; 59 years late.r
<lb/>I went to see it all, and 39 years later you go and there are still strong family ^
<lb/>and blood ties there. Sijq;)ly stated, your Father, of beloA;-ed memory, was Enid &amp; Olga s
<lb/>fiTvSt cousin, so you and Toya, bb-gnon (sp) etc are second cousins, and David &amp; Juan
<lb/>Carlos are third cousnns. You xrould be JC's second cousin once rem.oved, or, by the
<lb/>Ecuadorean system, tic abuelo en segundo. (l think,,, too late to figure it out now)
<lb/>Yes, we APJC getting older, aren't we? bias a time when dd. that was at my fingertips,
<lb/>I'm ecstatic at the prospect of seeing you and '-brida in October, and Deo volente,
<lb/>we'll all still be here by then. So far, so good on my side, though I m.ust admit
<lb/>middle age has its drax/backs. The hair, ok (we must compare pates), the teeth,
<lb/>gorgeous, the figure, x/ell and I'd like to l-cnox-r which bunch of ex-'il demons adds
<lb/>a step to my staircase each week. Mow I make a point of jnaking a shijpping list rather
<lb/>than just bounding gazelle-liixE dox-mstairs to the market. That is, when 1 remember.
<lb/>1 love to liave you see m.y place, xfnere I've lived 16 ,years. It is right in the

<lb/>Dear Chris;
<lb/>April 20, 1990
<lb/>Psrdon the ime^ipected, bolt from the blue aspect of the present, but I get
<lb/>ii-flpulsive. In the last year tvo friends of mine, contemporaries, have kicked off
<lb/>in their sleep, Ìa la Alfred, of coronaries, so I've decided to start packing off
<lb/>some of the enc-losed. That means organising, sorting, etc; no matter. I recall
<lb/>your interest as a Id.d in all this, so here's something to whet your appetite.
<lb/>Your 2nd cousin Bob and liis wife Â¥anda and kids David &amp; Rebekah went to Ecuador
<lb/>last year, and as they speak Spanish, I guess I'll ship them stuff in Spanish, in
<lb/>addition to the Albert stuff. There's iÂ£gis of stuff, and I just can't bring myself
<lb/>to pitch it outj sooner or later, someone will want it, or part of it. Besides,
<lb/>in. the meantime, the old photos bring back memories,
<lb/>best to you all, in particular your Mother, who a while back attained that
<lb/>which I'm sliding towards now, i,e,, 50, Horrors,
<lb/>Jo
<pb n="51" facs="#page-050"/>
<lb/>inlddle of the renovmed gay ghetto, which rather tlian off-putting I hope you'll
<lb/>find educational and intriguing. Yes, a car would be very useful, and you can
<lb/>probably get one at the airport. The Supershuttle will leave you right at m;/
<lb/>doorstep, but a car would enable us to get out of the city and see some of the
<lb/>exquisite beauty of these parts. In many ways it reminds me of Ecuador: must be
<lb/>the Pacific terrain, the volcanic nature of it all, the clear air (batch: when you're
<lb/>here it will be foggyi) It's an easy freeway/ drive of about jji-renty minutes to
<lb/>the airport. Parking around here is a bitch; I live on what just Tjliysically could
<lb/>be cpnroared, in teimis of traffic and congestion, to the Junction, and they've
<lb/>put up meters and parking signs, etc. But there are two public lots on this block
<lb/>and one can pop out &amp; feed the mpter. One's entrance is right across the street,
<lb/>but it's a question of iick. We'll see. durrently I'm working doing housepainting
<lb/>and similar things for friends,and by October, Vn o knpuTs? But the essence is that
<lb/>my schedule iÂ§ very flexible and we should be able to r/ork out something. tlie
<lb/>by, belated Congrats on the POth.
<lb/>I'm glad David met Anderson-lmbert. Such a nice m^n, and so intelligent. 1
<lb/>count him as the only rememb-erable thing to come out of my time at harvard in that
<lb/>PhD program period. 1 saw h^ra at some cnference here som.e years back and he was very
<lb/>kind and glad to s-ee me. He s 79 now. You can't give young people advice when you're
<lb/>the parent. It takes an uncle or grandm.other or something, and even then it's a
<lb/>losing proposition. One can only let themi find their way and try to steer the
<lb/>adversities out of their path. Of course, I don't know him, but an 18 vear old is
<lb/>an 18 year old, and we were once too, though that hardly seems possible now.
<lb/>Mu-st have been sombody else. I kept a diary when I was about 20 and I've just been
<lb/>reading it over lately. It's embarrassing j_n places, but a valuable insight ihto
<lb/>howr one's outlook changes ivith time. Must admit, though, it s probably more literate
<lb/>than a sj.milar output would be today, when someone would feckLessly consign his
<lb/>innermost to a floppy disk, conplete with misspellings. I'm. at as much of loss to
<lb/>understand me at 20 as you miight be writh David at 18. Don't worry unless he raises
<lb/>his arm and says "Haii" whenever someone mientions Newton Centre.Then worry.
<lb/>Well, enoghu. I have to toss my troi-rel early tomorrovj morning. (Yes, I still
<lb/>bate to get up early.) PS my phone (1j15) 626-3798. Ì ring me out an old Baptist
<lb/>hjnnnal if you remember. I have several of various denomJnations and I like looking
<lb/>though and seeing how this group or that deals with a particulajf tune. Besides,
<lb/>tbere are a couple of real toe-tappers I'd like to learn. There s one about them
<lb/>Crolden Bells which 1 think is Baptist and which I've heard ona record, but for which
<lb/>I've never found the music (in E flat, I think). Talk to you later.

<lb/>Drae Bob &amp; Wanda:
<lb/>V/ell, better late than never, and in time to avoid the evil rise in postal rates.
<lb/>I can remember when it cost and they delivered twice a day. Now it's ten times that
<lb/>and you're lucky if you ever get it. That's the trouble with living too long: you realise
<lb/>bow crummy ttiings have become, and how they're getting worse.
<lb/>First off, congratulations to David on the Mellon, and I hope he has come up with
<lb/>some sort of interesting and fruitful idea on what to do with it. Ecuadorean literature
<lb/>is not all one might hope for, in fact most of latin American Lit leave s something to be
<lb/>desired, but it can be of interest. It might be of greater interest(l) to do something on
<lb/>the immense political and social changes that occurred in Ecuador from 1895 on...the
<lb/>triumph of Alfaro and the liberals, wlikch brought about such improvements as religious
<lb/>toleration, civil registry, etc. You may jot know that Malvina was sort of the Horace Mann
<lb/>of Ecuador, in that she trained generations of normal teachers, ie teaching teachers to be
<lb/>teachers, of course before the domfall of the Liberals in 1912, but there were many
<lb/>things that various Lopezes did more or less on the sidelines that made changes that were
<lb/>irreversible and immune to ploitics. (rty typewriter has its own ideas os spelling.) The
<lb/>A.tlas was one of those changes. The Historia de una excomunion is really a very interesting
<lb/>historical sideline, and the evenhandedness with which Felicisimo describes it m.akes it
<lb/>worth reading about even though the issue is so long ago^ it delineates the sense of outrage
<lb/>at injustice that's so inbred in the line, even among those who are m.ore right-wingish.
<lb/>I think Nana would be a little dismayed at some of my own ideas on politics nowadays^ my
<lb/>own liberalness has been modified somewhat by the passage of time and events from the
<lb/>rather New Deal positions I grew up espousing, but I'm so against this immoral war and the
<lb/>entire erroneous scope of American Foreign policy in that area, fo so long, that I can
<lb/>still work up a sense of outrage. Perhaps the most enraging part of it all, outside the
<lb/>deaths on all sides, is the obvious mendacity of the reporting and the censorship. It all
<lb/>reminds me of Westmoreland and the "body counts" from Vietnam,. But I can't get into all
<lb/>that mess novi; that's sobrem.esa talk, not letter talk. As for the draft, if there is one,
<lb/>it is clearly to be avoided at all costs, kdiat young people, brainwashed, are to lay down
<lb/>their lives for now willtomorrow be out of date and reversed. I would have "checked the box"
<lb/>as used to say, or gone to Canada had I been called up, but I was spared; maybe it was
<lb/>the guardian angel. I started Brookljm College at night, for 3y years, and in Feb of '62
<lb/>switched to daj" school; got up to register at 8 AM and came home at 10 to find my Greetings
<lb/>notice in the nailboxi Placed back to school and asked what to do; they said Get a deferraent.
<lb/>I asked what a deferment ras....I was rather naiveabout some thj.ngs then... and I got them
<lb/>for all my suhsecfuent student career, and later, in 67-69, as a teacher, and by that tim-e
<lb/>I y&amp;s too old, and coming fir-om Brooklyn was better tlian being from some hole in the wall
<lb/>toâ¢ where there were fewer candidates for cannon fodder. The story goes that Victor was
<lb/>called doâ¢ in 1918 for the draft, but on the way home on the trolley he saw the announce
<lb/>ment on the sign of the now long defunct Brooklyn Tim.es, like the NY Times on in Times
<lb/>Square, that the Armistice had been declared. He was too old in 19h2; Alfred was turned
<lb/>down for low blood pressure, George was sent to Palestine, not where bullets were flying,
<lb/>and Albert managed to survive some of the w^orst theaters of war in the Pacific, all of
<lb/>which makes Estenio Lopes, Nana's y-unger brother, who died as a result of wounds in a
<lb/>revolutionarj'- skirmish in 1896 at the age of 16, the last person to have bought it as a
<lb/>â¢war casualty, and it should stay that w ay. Politics is nothing to die or get hurt for,
<lb/>and when all is said and done, I'm not thiat sure that Saddam Hussein is that much worse
<lb/>that Shamir or Sharon. But not to get into politics....
<lb/>I'm we]lL, there have been no further strokes yet, the HIV doesn't seem to be doing
<lb/>anything so far, so I'm waiting to see -s^hat happens. As far as is concerned, I have it
<lb/>unofficially that the SSDI and SSI â¢will go through , since the medical papers say I'â,
<lb/>still totally disabled. I'm not, of course, but I might be some day...I' e seen too many
<lb/>friends cash in their cMps to be too optimistic, and for app. S650 mthly, which doesn't
<pb n="53" facs="#page-052"/>
<lb/>even amount to a small bombing run, if I'm called in to let them see me, I'll drag my
<lb/>fppt and drool and lose my train of thought and the like. It'll make up for the Title VI
<lb/>fellowshio they revoked on me during Vietnam, after some students barricaded some Dow
<lb/>Chem rep at Harvard, which was what made me get a teaching jobrn which vas what made ine
<lb/>realize that the world of Academe ain't all it seems to be once you look at it from the
<lb/>real world. I'm alone here now, my roommate having left beginning of January sort of by
<lb/>mutual agreement. He's more advanced with HIV and I felt he really needed to be in some
<lb/>sort of alternative living situation where his diet and general wellbej_ng are monitored
<lb/>by pro's. His analyst and others agr-eed, and he finally went along v/ith it. He suffers
<lb/>from incipient dementia, the main trait of whivh is denial; with all sorts of minor but
<lb/>uiamistakeable physical complaints, he still has trouble accepting his positivity, and I
<lb/>felt that the last thing I needed was a ward. It also gave me som.e experience close-hand,
<lb/>so maybe I'll know what to look for when I start to lose m.y marbles, if that happens.
<lb/>Some say it has al-ready happened, but all great men have their detractors. Ideally I'll
<lb/>find someone who needs office space, or a travelling person like a steward, somebody who
<lb/>â vxill help out with the minimal rent I pay and will then take a powder, I'm crotchety
<lb/>enough, in fact I'm very crotchety, to not want anybody around all the tim.e, unless of
<lb/>course he loves cleaning and cooking and is utterly devoted to m.e and the cats, '-iaybe I
<lb/>can find a monk.
<lb/>Talked with Joan the other night,* all is well as can he hoped. Grace can be a little
<lb/>troublesome, since Joan says Grace has learned hov; to las'- guilt trips. I hear much the sam.e
<lb/>from friends who still have aged or infirm parents; ironically, I really had four parents,
<lb/>and I was spared all that, but I can sympathize. Galled Dennis a while back to find out
<lb/>what was new, but I got his machine and he hasn't called back. Georgiann says all is well,
<lb/>though she's concerned that he eldest son wants to become a fireman; she's sure he'll fall
<lb/>on his head like hispoor father did; she says kids are doomed'.' Seems someone got drurjl:
<lb/>and droAre into George's stoop on E li2nd, demolishing it, and that afterwards there was a
<lb/>windstorm and a tree fell onto the house. Always something. I'm. glad the familj'' reunion
<lb/>went well and you all got a chance to renew the contact. I haven't seen Linda since I960,
<lb/>and now everybody has grown up kids and time m.arches on. I agree, I like Eliza very much.
<lb/>She's very nice, and I think they work well together. It's funny, but Dwight, the eldest
<lb/>son who lives here, has a Chinese girlfriend, I don't recall her name, who is also an
<lb/>architect. Nobody can say the clan isn't broadmindedi Spoke with Laura when Laura Lou
<lb/>called a while back, and got off fairly lightly; since we both h3.ve had strokes, the
<lb/>medical disquisitions could have been endless! She sounds very content and I'm glad the
<lb/>criange has suited her. She must have lived at 2$20 as long as we did at 21lU. I can't
<lb/>imagine what that all looks like now, and I don't think I'd like to see it again; better
<lb/>to remiember it as it was, Somewhowl can hear your Father saying "Abandon shd-pl"
<lb/>Yes, there will be some more packages of papers and stuff som.edaj^; mj'' tasks of
<lb/>organizing continue and Istill want to get it all off my hands while I'm still coherent,
<lb/>khen I was in LA in October I gave Leslie and Karen a bunch of photos and I admit I felt a
<lb/>sort of thrill at telling one of Leslie's daughters that the lady in the picture was her
<lb/>grandmother's greatgrandm.other. Sort of puts it in perspective, sort of like when I see a
<lb/>movie that's now considered a classic or almost prehistoric, and I remember seeing it
<lb/>when it first came out. I mentioned to some whippersnapper recently that I rememibered when
<lb/>FDR died and he looked at me as if I was talking about the Oivil War. If I had asked him
<lb/>whE about Kefauver he'd probably have thought it was a car!

<lb/>April 1, 1992
<lb/>Dear Linda:
<lb/>I was glad to get your letter, but very sad about your awful burner.
<lb/>Not to diminish the physical side of it, in itself considerable, but the
<lb/>really awful part must be^the long periods of uncertainty and fear, plus
<lb/>the frustration at delays in medical matters. The sister of a friend of
<lb/>mine went through all this a while back ( a single), so I'm a bit more
<lb/>aware of the details than Iras before. She too is fine now and adjusting.
<lb/>Ken &amp; Eliza just called an hour ago, to say that they'll be out here later
<lb/>thife month and Eliza told me.about the reasons for the decision to go ahead
<lb/>with it, get it over with, and it made sense to me. How fortunate that the
<lb/>whole iirplant business story broke when it did so that , future bummers were
<lb/>avoided. Eliza mentioned that it's a bit of a problem raising your arms,
<lb/>but I assTome that there are physical therapy things one can do, to make the
<lb/>remaining musculature more flexible with time. But I'm afraid your,cheer-
<lb/>leading days are over, and you'll definitely have, to give up ont he idea of
<lb/>a career in basketballl Oh well. thoughts are, with you, love.
<lb/>Now, jy medical stories. As of today, aid this is the first I type it,
<lb/>I am officially a FVJA,, ie a person with Aids, not because of any change in
<lb/>iry condition, but because today the CDC/Feds/powers that be changed the
<lb/>terms of the definition so that people who were before unable to qualify for
<lb/>assistance and/or $|/prograras, like women and IV druggies, no, longer fall
<lb/>betvreen the cracks. Since I'm already on Social Security and have Medi-Cal,
<lb/>it doesn't affect me, and I find it funny that, as I've said before, all of
<lb/>a sudeen with a stroke of the pen 1'^ a statistic. On the physical side
<lb/>of me,, I've stopped taking ddc, thate^erimental drug, because the neuropathy
<lb/>in my feet and legs, the tingling, etc.. got worse and there were oven sporadic
<lb/>shooting pains, which made it hard to sleep well, not always, but enough so
<lb/>that you never know whether you're going t o have a good day next morning.
<lb/>Seems neuropathy happens more at night for reasons they don't understand, and
<lb/>it has to do with the nemre endings in much the s arne was as people with MS
<lb/>notice. So I have an app't with the neurologist next week; the effects are
<lb/>alleged to diminish after the drug is stopped, so I'll see. Drs are so apt
<lb/>to just advise som.ething else and then sheepishly tell you that the new
<lb/>Rx has the side effect of making hair grow on your toenails or something,
<lb/>lyy friends deserve Congressional citations for putting up with all my
<lb/>complaining and the grumpiness that the irregular sleep causes. At least
<lb/>I don't have to work or keep a regvilar schedule, so I can nap and rest
<lb/>at will, and of course I still have my extraordinary good looks. Outside
<lb/>of that appendicitis 10 yrs ago, I've never had to concern myself with my
<lb/>health, so this business of taking pills and not always feeling up to snuff
<lb/>and having to spend mental energy on how I feel is a real nuisance. I under
<lb/>stand now why old people tend to be gminpy, little do we know...
<lb/>Joan says Grace is going along well, and that the blood or marrow
<lb/>cancer so far hasn't made too much difference in her general health. I think
<lb/>I mentioned that Joan has a medical care lady come in I think twice weekly
<lb/>to bathe her and do all those things that are so hard for one's children
<lb/>to do, dl of which takes a lot of strain off Joan's shouders. Grace is
<lb/>8l now, so it's to besqaected. Karen told me they all got together at Xmas
<pb n="55" facs="#page-054"/>
<lb/>and thd; Grace asw in her glory, and that they took pictures, which
<lb/>I haven't seen yet, including one of Grace and her granddaughter's
<lb/>granddaughter.'Ji (!Cwo of Leslie's dtrs had kids at the same time)
<lb/>Most of her hair is still black, too; she got Papa(s genes on that.
<lb/>Bobby was here last Friday (brought me a snapshot of the time
<lb/>you all got together last Summer/Fall) since he was to preside at some
<lb/>seminar or give a talk or something at the Pacific School of-Religion
<lb/>over in Berkeley; he had a free day so he came over and we spent the day
<lb/>together, took a long waGJc (I had an energetic.day) and caught up on
<lb/>the last 22 yrs. Same old Bobby,'always so up and cheerful. It was-really
<lb/>good to. see him. He, Â¥anda and Rebekah will be out here in the Summer and
<lb/>they'll have,more free-time. I tbld him that at a party I had recently' met
<lb/>this guy who had taught at Brooklyn College about 5 yrs back, and that
<lb/>in the course of opr Brooklyn chat he happened to mention the "low-income
<lb/>apartments" across from, BCi That got a laugh, ^ ^ -
<lb/>I've been corresponding lately with Raymond Timmons, Georgiann's
<lb/>2nd son, who lives in Coltonbia, S.C. He started witing around Mew Years
<lb/>after talking with George. He has a dfpree in Visual Arts and is to take up
<lb/>a teaching position at some college in Greenville.(Media Arts, not Visual)
<lb/>He ts, interested in old family things since hele^lized recently that he knows
<lb/>little about who, when, where, why, etc. He wants to sit George down in front
<lb/>of a camcorder and get him to recotint. He single, 26, and has a girlfriend
<lb/>from ill. Very perceptive yotmg man; he says the kinds of things I would have
<lb/>at his age (i) Very much George's grandchild. Very vehbose, too, so he'll
<lb/>make up for Chris' laconichess, which by the way is no problem with me.
<lb/>I always find it fascinating to exchange ideas with the next generation
<lb/>because they're so different, of course, but then they'll say something
<lb/>wrhich just screams 2111 Glenwood Rd and you wonder, NOw where did that
<lb/>come from? ,
<lb/>Well, enough. Keep up your spirits, which I know you will anyway,
<lb/>Eliza mentioned you had gone back to the shoppe, and I think that's a good
<lb/>sign, Noimialcy is very salubrious, best to Jim and your family.
<lb/>Jfcch love.

<lb/>Dear Ken &amp; KLiza:
<lb/>Hope this finds you all well and in good spirits, and enjoying the
<lb/>wonderful New England Spring, which as I remember can tend to be rather overcast,
<lb/>parjjicularly on weekends, I'm well, though lately I've been feeling a bit tired
<lb/>and showing more weight, rather bulge, around the middrift than can be explained by
<lb/>overeating, though no weight increase. !&gt;tyself, I tend to blame the AZT and Septra
<lb/>I've been popping on dr's orders for mths now...never did thinkt oo much of medicines.,,
<lb/>quackery, tomfoolery, I say. Also belching a lot. So now that I'm on Medical and
<lb/>Social Security (perfect thing to be when the economy is so lousy) I've had the drs
<lb/>take samples of everything and order tests of everything to see v/hat they come up with,
<lb/>I refuse to consider any changes in diet, particularly as far as grease is concerned,
<lb/>or coffee, or red wine w/dinner, I've already cut down on salt, what can they ask of me
<lb/>more? None of all this sounds HIV related, so it must be something else, all of which is
<lb/>irksome because if i get too paunchy, I'll look funny in Speedos on a skateboard, horrorsi
<lb/>Anyway, I've been in touch with Georgie lately, and it came up that, in tme family
<lb/>tradition, he too is a letter saver. I sent him the letters he vrrote to my Mother &amp; Victor
<lb/>during W II, and he responded gy telling me that ray collection was nothing in comparison
<lb/>to the inches tall pile he has in boxes in his cellar; he and Ann wrote daily from 'ii2 to
<lb/>'lt5, not to mention all the other letters. He said he had some from my Mother, and I asked
<lb/>h3.m to send me xeroxes, since I really remember nothing of her. Fell, the other day I got
<lb/>one from her that he could find right away, plus five from Nana in Spanish, which as you
<lb/>can imagine have quite bowled me overl The ones from Nana...it's like hearing her talk,
<lb/>very funny, moving, reminiscent, insightful, in short fascinating. The one from ny Mother,
<lb/>wliich I'm including a copy of, was a revelation. All of a sudden someone very in^jortant
<lb/>in one's past has a voice, speaks, and what she saysj T'Jhat a newsy letter, and since it
<lb/>says so much about all us "kids" of the time, I knew you'd find it interesting. I'm
<lb/>sending a copy to Joan and Linda too.
<lb/>Called Joan, but no answer. Then called Karen &amp; Leslie (different towns in vast
<lb/>Southern California wildejuess) and it seems there was a Mother s Day do chez Leslie &amp;
<lb/>I must have just missed Joan. I hear Grace is doing fine, holding her own, looking and
<lb/>feeling good, and Joan has been prescribed a tranquilizer by her dr to help her in dealing
<lb/>with the traumas of caring for an aged, infirm and often crotchety parent. George sent
<lb/>me some recent snaps, as per my request, and I made xeroxes of them to send along to you
<lb/>so you can see the veritable miracle of just how he hasn't changed in years. Does that
<lb/>look like a 78 year old man? He sounds just the same, too. He has kept busy after retiring,
<lb/>in fact he says he can't find time to do a 11 the things he wants to. He allcyvred as how Ann
<lb/>is showing her age somewhat, but he did sya this in a low voice and told me everybcxiy was
<lb/>aSleep by that time. We must have talked three hrsi Genes, genes.
<lb/>Ok, that's all for now. Again, hope all is well. Oh, had a letter from Bob &amp; Wanda
<lb/>telling, midst tther stuff, about the get-together, which they enjoyed. I hope it all went
<lb/>well, since I started it all; wish I could have been a fly on the wallj

<lb/>Dear Linda;
<lb/>I  ..Aging, eccentric'cousins are like bad pefinies...they keep turning up at no
<lb/>notice, but t^his time bearing .gifts, First off, I hope this'finds you,- Jim &amp; the
<lb/>yoUng'ns all well, 1 guess Casey is at school up in Massachusetts now, from what
<lb/>I heard about the cousinly reunion that'i^appened, partly at my urging, and which I
<lb/>-hope went well,. everybody had a a'good tiitÂ®, no one got too bored, etc etc. Oh to have
<lb/>been a fly on the wall! Had a card from Bob &amp; Wanda the other dayj David is about to
<lb/>,go off to,Ecuador to do his research^"about which I'm-sure you've heard tons, Never â 
<lb/>met the kid, spoke with h^m once;.,seems nice. Smart too, enough-so to get a couple of
<lb/>grants.to do research. I sent him all the books and papers I have regarding Felicisimo
<lb/>the Ecuadorean chapters,.,he reads, Spanish and carries the name and itfe t|idt much
<lb/>more bric-a-brac.off .'my back, so, to speak,. In more hifalootih't terms, I'm passing the
<lb/>torch. Ironic that he should be gping off to Quito just wheh there s cholera abroad!
<lb/>I hope he doesn't become another family statistic.
<lb/>Apropos of statistics'^, one night raths ago I wasisatching the news; it was before we
<lb/>starjfed dropping bombs in thp most redemt atrocity, and they were showing various GI's
<lb/>(do they still call them that?), saying",this &amp; that and how they hoped to be home soon,
<lb/>etc. All soldiers look alike in uniforms, and it^r vision isn't what it was, but what
<lb/>should .rny incredulous eyes see on the screen but the name "Christopher Mosher" below
<lb/>one of the young men as he spoke HI As you-know, I've ne er met Chris, and the only
<lb/>adult picture I have is one of you. Ken, Chris &amp; Casey at Ken's place a couple of years
<lb/>ago, and â with the helmut and all, and the rapidity of the scene, I couldn't tell. But
<lb/>what a coincidence, so very much in keeping, it would be iftjiat was indeed him. And if
<lb/>it was/is, I hope he's back by now and all is well, ' '
<lb/>All is more or less well with me, despite some recent now vanished gastric oddities
<lb/>and some even more recent further vision troubles (read another mini-stroke), and as for
<lb/>HIV-related things, everybody, drs, medical people, friends, etc, says I look fine, I am
<lb/>fine, not to worry, etc. I don't worry; I observe, wait, complain about being middle-aged
<lb/>and lacking the zip of yesteryear (you may sympathize), but since I have Medical, when a
<lb/>bill comes in I affix a sticker, sued it back, and that's that, I get Social Security,
<lb/>have Medical, don't have to work,,.I've never had it so good, I guess. Recession? 'What^^s
<lb/>that? VJhat, me worry? and all that. Health is a very boring matter.
<lb/>Anyway, a while baok I was talking w/George and it came out that he has abunch of
<lb/>letters from TeW II, in fact, hundreds of them, and he^nt me some xeroxes, at my request,
<lb/>because I wanted to find ou-t about my Mother, whom I don't remember and about whom I've
<lb/>always been curious, G said he had several letters from her, but so far he's only found
<lb/>the one i^hose copy I include, as I did for Ken &amp; Joan, because she talks about you all
<lb/>when she s not going on about me. Obviously, for me the letter was a revelation^ all of
<lb/>a sudden this lady, this missing shadcft^, this face in pictures, has a voice, she
<pb n="82" facs="#page-081"/>
<lb/>speaks, like Garbo, and what a newsy and interesting letter it is. I hope Georgia-'
<lb/>comes across some others. I recognized which photos she was describing and xeroxed
<lb/>them, a bit of detective-worki;.,:!),polls of -that size, film had 8 exposures 2) I
<lb/>couldtell by th^ crinkly edgep that theye yrere.-all^from the^. same^batoh. if know you've
<lb/>seen these beforej now there's a historical qontext. I.know.âI'm still _a chatterlDOx;
<lb/>what about you?. Georgip^so sent me, some copies of letters,he ^Ot from Wana, #hich
<lb/>date fi'om i;2Â»'a week 'before Papa,â  died^(^/l/Uii)}-.and those, were just as Wonderful'. It
<lb/>wag like hearing herp speak again,, and laugh, etc. And,of course,."there are fuhny stories
<lb/>in those.lettehSi in one of whichiNana mentions...the context is too long to go into
<lb/>here., .thatr'if it could be s^id-that I was a cry'baby,,;^hen you were a "whybaby^' ie that
<lb/>if"something happened that we didn't like, or understand., I'd start crying and you'd
<lb/>ask â  "wtQr?'.Â» She tells of takingi-me. bo- .Brighton Beach and the^ pool for kiddies there, and
<lb/>hta it was a- supcessful'trip and: that she wants to go back again and take you too,'but
<lb/>(free: transtaion) '"but then Stella starts in with.. .the kid has to take a"? nap after lunch
<lb/>and so on'.' See what yojunissed? . . Ì Ì  1 ^ â 
<lb/>I'm including some xeroxes of- color shots for your amusement. If you don't have the
<lb/>'negative, if someone sends you the picture-, .you can put several photographs do^m and
<lb/>xerox them all. for &amp;1.^^0, less than the prints would cost. Ann has-been a blonde for
<lb/>years now pnd she has had sone cataract troixble, but is fine. TcJhat s really astounding
<lb/>is Georgiep no one wouM believe ybu if you,told them that this is a man in his late
<lb/>70's.' And his voice too, strong and firm, in no way like what one would expect for that
<lb/>age. ' , â  â  - Â° . .V . '
<lb/>. Anyvray, thisi is betting longish, and I have to get ready for the theater. Peter
<lb/>'Ustinov is'deing a one-man show which is supposed to be very funny. Again, I hope '
<lb/>you're all well and together. ,

<lb/>Some repetitious addenda on the worthies in the picture:
<lb/>(l) is the lady whose death in 1913 precipitated the inheritance battle which
<lb/>caused Papa (^) to spend 5 yrs in Quito. With what was left of his share of the
<lb/>legacy, he made the down payment on the house at 2im Glenwood Rd., B'klyn.
<lb/>(3) 7 (8) had other children after this pictxire was taken, among them a baby
<lb/>Diocelina (which is of course the Spanish equivalent for Jocelyn), an Estela,
<lb/>and the Enrique Hurtado who visited Brooklyn in the 1920's, the only one ever to
<lb/>meet his Pazmino Lopez cousins, Enrique Trajano Hurtado (8) was known as Trajano,
<lb/>and his son Enrique Huirtierto (12) as Humberto, to avoid confusion (')â¢
<lb/>(ii), Rosario Pazmino, later remarried Jose Davalos and had three children,
<lb/>Homero, who visited Brooklyn in the 20's, Edma who never married and is
<lb/>currently dead, and Amaya, vdio married a Chilean, Clodomiro (j) Cabezas and
<lb/>may be still alive in Chile, She had one son, Jose Cabezas Davalos.
<lb/>Rosario's 1957 obituary lists the last names of aH her family members and those
<lb/>of her sister's &amp; brother's children. By now, the numbers are legion.
<lb/>(5) V.M.Pazmino had seven sturviving children, among them U sons; his sisters
<lb/>aguoBg them had about another dozen, and of all this mob there is at this time
<lb/>between (9/91) only one male Pazmino, David, likely to carry the name
<lb/>beyond the i;th generation. That's show bizl
<lb/>(10) Lucila married an Andrade and had one son. Otto, Trtao visited Brooklyn in
<lb/>1962 and met Nana &amp; Victor, Albert, George, etc. He is married and may now live^
<lb/>in Bogota, Colombia. Her father Emil Stahlschmidt wx (9) was a Dane and a
<lb/>pharmacist in Quito. Her brother Guillermo (11) was retarded, poor baby, or a
<lb/>simpleton, choose your definition, and never married. Unfortunate.

<lb/>LETTERS TO OEORCffi FROM: (Excerpts)
<lb/>Victor Tuesday, Sept, 8, 19h2
<lb/>Kenneth and I went swimming yesterday, perhaps for the last time this
<lb/>season. It was cool, but sunny and dry. Harry did not go with us. He went to
<lb/>Erasmus Field instead to see a semi-pro baseball game. The Bushwicks, I think,
<lb/>were playing......You may have read about the air raid alarm at 2:30 A.M.
<lb/>Monday morning. The banshee went off, waking up everybody in the house. I put
<lb/>the radio on and found the prograns going on as asual, with no announcement
<lb/>whatever of any alarm. The next morning, or rather the same day,it was announced
<lb/>that an unidentified plane had been spotted. It turned out to be friendly
<lb/>The kids, that is, Kenneth &amp; Joan, are preparing their minds for the inevitable
<lb/>school. They do not like to be reminded of it. Fortunate fyhey are to have only
<lb/>that to worry them. Kenneth is being taken to the dentist tonight by Harry &amp;
<lb/>Stella, Sftar that they are going t o call on his cousin Katherine and her
<lb/>friend ELsa. I'l^. st^y with Linda until Mama arrives about 7:30 P.M....Little
<lb/>Joe has just awakened from his nap. He talks considerably now. He has learned
<lb/>to call people "coo-coo", "Alfred coo-coo" he will say, or Tita coo-cool' He
<lb/>laughs when he says it.
<lb/>Victor Tuesday Sept IS?, 19)4.2

<lb/>Yotir letter to Stella where jrou thank Harry for his kind generosity in

<lb/>we've been living in this house. Here I can really use that phrase of Mamita's

<lb/>all people can live a normal life, when the horror is over of this war, which

<lb/>Kenneth, Harry and I went to see the Didgers play the Cubs last week. Dem ,
<lb/>Bums were swamped 19-2, Kenneth had been asking Harry to to take him to Kobet s
<lb/>Field for months. Kennetli finally saw his first big league game, diiring the
<lb/>week before school opened. Harry had always demured, thJLnking that Kenneth would
<lb/>become bored before the end of the ganÂ®.Nothing of the sort happened, Kenneth
<lb/>was very interested right up to the last out Tes, I think little Joe got
<lb/>the coo-coo business from Joan, She denies it, but from whom else could he have
<lb/>learned it? He is a little rascal. He bawls people out now, in a regular grown-up
<lb/>tone of voice. Wheneber I do something he does not Ì prove of, he froivns, bangs
<lb/>the table and says "No, Bity, No, Bityy Bity meaning Vicky,,,It is novr 2 P.M.

<lb/>She says that there is nothing for her to do until that time. She has exhausted

<lb/>As you know, Joe arrived home very unexpectedly.,.,,Little Joe remembered
<lb/>his dad very well, lam told that it was "Daddy, Iteddy, Daddyy Do this and do that"
<lb/>all Saturday morning. This short interlude of normal living f or tiiera is
<lb/>pathetic as well as joyous, I am certain that 93'^ of thw world's populajsion
<lb/>must long for the end of these unhappy times,...Neither Alfred nor I have heard

<lb/>Since I didn't have space then (she refers to a letter from Lu to George)
<lb/>I couldn't clear u|i for you the guilt that has fallen on poor Joan, that it was

<lb/>I'm writing this in Kenneth's house on his typewriter. He is sitting here
<lb/>beside me. We are down in the pl^roora in the cellar. Harry has gone to the
<pb n="90" facs="#page-089"/>
<lb/>Hockey gameÂ® Today is the first day they play To-u have beenaray for four
<lb/>months now. Tou'd be surprised at the advance the kids have made. Kenneth is
<lb/>quite a grown-up now. The other day Linda happened to trip in the kitchen.
<lb/>She got a terrible bump on her forehead. In the excitement that ensued Kenneth
<lb/>kept his head. He forthwith opened the phone bpok and got the doctor's number
<lb/>for Harry. He also had the presence of mind to turn off the gas in the kitchen
<lb/>stove, where, otherwise, t he food could have burned. He stayed at home to mind
<lb/>the house while Idnda was taken to the doctor's, Linda is allright now. Linda
<lb/>is like a little lady, the way she talks and acts. Her vocabulary is growing by
<lb/>the minute. She is mischeivous, but atill a little lady. On Sundays she comes
<lb/>with us on our rides t o tie pai^k. She had been to the Zoo, and dven has had a ride
<lb/>on a pony,...Joan is growing up fast too. She and Kenneth play very differently
<lb/>from the way they used to even jusr four months agaa They are more settled and
<lb/>matter of fact.,,,And little Josephi You'd be surprised at the w ay he talks now.
<lb/>It's anazing the way ha suddenly developed speech, as if making up for lost time.
<lb/>He goes all over the house by himself, climbs stairs, c ones into my room when
<lb/>I am drawing and asks for pencil and paper. He is very mischeivous. He has not
<lb/>taken an afternoon nap in weeks, Mama and Lu have given up trying to put him to
<lb/>sleep Kenneth wants to go down with me to get an ice cream soda at the
<lb/>drag store. It is a little chilly for this, I recall, though, that we used to
<lb/>have them in the dead of winter.

<lb/>I'm writing thid in Kenneth's house on his typewriter. It is 2:30 and Harry
<lb/>has gone to the Hockey game, I am in the cellar. Kenneth is in his workshop
<lb/>building a huge model plane which ha assures me will fly. The wing span alone
<lb/>is inches long. Â¥e are wondering how he is going to get it out of the cellar
<lb/>once it is finished, Harry has agreed on paper togive him onedollar if it
<lb/>flies 50 feet. I served as a witness to the agreement. The model is one of the
<lb/>presents Kenneth got for Christmas, In fact, this modelis so bigtViat he has
<lb/>to make it on the ping pong table....After I finish this letter I am gcslng to
<lb/>try to fix Kenneth s portable radio. He let it drop and cracked the plastic
<lb/>case, Harry bought"some gxtra ambroid for this purpose, I tried to make a
<lb/>wooden case last Sunday, Everything went fine until I got to the front panel.
<lb/>Then the trouble beganJ I couldn't saw the round opening for the loudspeaker.
<lb/>When I had finished the opening it looked like a lop-sided window, Linda is
<lb/>using the box for a doll house now,
<lb/>Victor Sunday Jan, 10, 19lt3
<lb/>Linda is here beside me while I write. She rants to write on the typewriter
<lb/>herself, so you see I am having a little difficulty, Kenneth is working on his
<lb/>model, that is, his latest. He informs me that it is the Curtis f-11 C ii Goshawk,
<lb/>whatever that is. He has already finished his giant flying plane but is unable
<lb/>to get it out. This is due not only to the weather but also to the new prohibition
<lb/>of the use of cars. Harry is not allowed to use his car for "pleasure',' We are
<lb/>therefore unable to go to Prospect Park. The plane is too big to take into a train,
<lb/>,...Things are getting pretty bad here. Butter, coffee, meats, and many other
<lb/>things are getting pretty hard to get. We have been unable to get chocolate or
<lb/>cocoa for Sunday nights. Even bread is retsricted to the extent that bakers
<lb/>cannot sell loaves sliced on their mehines, Harry is worried lest he be unable
<lb/>to get enough oil for his furnace .Well, George, this is about all for now,
<lb/>Linda is getting restless. She is climbing up on diaire and throwing things on
<pb n="91" facs="#page-090"/>
<lb/>the floor. She has just broken a leg of a table which I shall try to fix.
<lb/>Kenneth is still working on his model.

<lb/>Victor has already toM you in his letter of yesterday tha'^ Joan has fallen
<lb/>ill with the plague of chicken pox, a week ago. Grace says she s much better
<lb/>now, just bored with having to stay in her room. They've put a table across the
<lb/>doorway so Joseph won't go in. Looks like the boy will escape it. Victor also
<lb/>beat me to the punch in his letter in telling you of Joseph's cleverness in
<lb/>remembering you and the color of the shirts you used to wear. When he is asked
<lb/>"Where is George?y he runs to the living room window and points in the diirection
<lb/>of 21st Street. He remembers the many times hewas with me on the porch and
<lb/>he saw you go off in that direction. When he hears you spoken of, he says "I
<lb/>want to write a letter to Georgi^'/ and asks for paper and pencil. Tte boy's
<lb/>memory is truly remarkable, That s uhy he recognized Joe as soon as he saw him,
<lb/>Linda aL so r emembers you instantly as soon as she sees a picture, All the kids
<lb/>will have a great tin;Â© wl^n the happy day arrives that we are together again.

<lb/>Joan is practically ober the chicken pox, Grace is going to keep her home
<lb/>from school another week. Since Kenneth has been bringinh home her work, she
<lb/>has kept up with her lessons...During the week, little Joe also came down with
<lb/>the disease. His case, thouidi, is very mild. In facfe, he's more active than ever,
<lb/>Lucile has kept him in. He and Joan raise Cain. Pandemonium reigns all day long
<lb/>in their apartment. I think they will come over during the coming week if weather
<lb/>permit s. To see them no one would believe that they were sick. There are no
<lb/>visible marks on their faces, and very few on their bodies, Kenneth
<lb/>WBites his letters by himself, I do not have to give him any help or suggestions
<lb/>&gt;dT.atever. I agree with you that he writes remarkably well. He is doing very well
<lb/>in school also. He is now in Ì B.
<lb/>Victor Saturday March 6, 19h3
<lb/>I know that your tarining, as mine, has been to prefer the truth at all
<lb/>times. We know that there is no use in trying to escape from reality. For this
<lb/>reason I have never tried to hide anything from you. However, there is nothing
<lb/>here at home over wliich you may worry. We are all well. Moreover, it is in
<lb/>keeping with this preference for reality to realize that our immediare feara
<lb/>may never be realized, Joan is over her illness. She went to the movies last
<lb/>night. She is returning to school on Monday, Little Joe also is practically
<lb/>over the chicken pox. In fact, I can't find a mark on him....I am writing this
<lb/>today because I may not have any time tomorrow, Sunday. The hockey season is
<lb/>almost over. Harry has bougtit tickets for Kenneth and me for tomorrow's game...
<lb/>Today is Saturday but Kenneth and I have not gone to the movies. The weather
<lb/>is rainy, and Kenneth decided to stay home...Joe is still in Bermuda. He believes
<lb/>his -work there will be over in a bout a month. If it is he will then return home.
<lb/>He may be walking ri^t into a unifosmi. He realizes this. It is a fear which
<lb/>we all have to face.

<lb/>We've jQ.1 been sick with colds, or rather, mild cases of flu. Kenneth
<lb/>was out of school A. 1 week, IAn.da is getting over a cough and fevei^a last
<lb/>Sunday night I felt chills, bones ached, and I coughed. By Monday, however,
<lb/>I was okay. Ihen Lu had the same thing. Then little Joe got sick, stomach
<lb/>trouble. Joan was next, with this mild flu. She stayed away from school.
<lb/>There is ai epidemic of this flu all over the midwest ard east,,, .Alfred then
<lb/>got it. I^pa has been coughing and sneezing. Finally, Ifema got the ehills.
<lb/>We are ail better now, though. We've been taking Bromo tablets and the famous

<lb/>without prescriptions. It seems there's a scarcity,,..,.You say you are going to

<lb/>It started with Kenneth's when he was a baby. Well, little Joe's vehicle was
<lb/>all but demolished. They say they are going to take what's left of the wicker-
<lb/>work out and substitute a wooden booc, I have isy doubts as to how this is going to
<lb/>look, I'm glad I won't be oushing the thing through the streets. I'll let you
<lb/>know more about this wooden chariot next weekÂ®,,,,Kenneth is only al^-sn, but ha

<lb/>Kenneth's room. This was smaller than the first one we made, but twice as hard
<lb/>to make. This was dou to the fact that the wood Harry got was warped and I do

<lb/>is going to call the doctor for further prescriptions. I thirdc he should take

<lb/>will start to accumulate in his legs again. He always gets up for breakfast.
<lb/>Sometimes he stays up all d ay and sometimes he goes back to bed. You know how
<lb/>he is. For years he wouldn't go out even to the porch. He has to change his
<lb/>mental attitude and stop sighing and grunting. He makes himself worse than he
<lb/>is by trying his hardest to be melancholy. He ends up by becoming a little grouchy,
<lb/>,..The kids: have all had a wonderful time this Qiristmas week, Joey got a tricycle
<lb/>and an automcbile, You can't get these things now. Joe was lucky to get the

<lb/>very quiet..,,You should see Linda skate now. She's a regular "wizV She has
<lb/>gone ahead of Kenneth on this. He can't skate yet, I saw Linda learning to
<lb/>skate, She would fall at every foot but this did not stop her. She'd get right
<lb/>up again and go on for another foot. I told her she was going to get hurt. She
<lb/>said she knew it, but that she had to learn to skate. Now she skates like Joan.
<lb/>She *s a little torn boy. She wrestles with Kenneth, Every time she sees me she

<lb/>I finally gotmy njicome tax filed and amiled. I took off for dependants, taxes
<lb/>and interest. In this way what I had to pay was $38.28. What Alfred had to pay will

<lb/>my head would look dirty, like a week s worth of beard. If it keeps on growing

<lb/>Joey yelling downstairs. I think he wants to play wi.th water. He stands in

<lb/>tea kettles for hours at a time. Streams of water have a curious fascination
<lb/>for him. He insists on doing his business in the bathrppm on the second iloor
<lb/>instead of in the toilet in the back. This is because he wants to see the more
<lb/>intricate flush in the more modem bowl,,,,The old bush in the vaxk yar^d is

<lb/>he is somewliere else, I can't ascribe tliis to reason or faith,It is only a deep
<lb/>feeling. Perhaps I shouldn't say "only',' Perhaps feeling is the most real thing
<lb/>we possess, We are all well. Everything is going on as usual, I hear Linda

<lb/>Lola, Kenneth, Linda, Dennis and I, besides Harry, were squeezed in the car,
<lb/>Stella and Kenneth went in the water. I have no bathing trunks, I have to buy
<lb/>a new pair. We took our lunch to eat at tie beach. Wait a minute, I forgot Joey,
<lb/>He went too. How could I have forgotten him? He sat on lap all the way down
<lb/>and all the way back,,,.When Harry s watch said 5:30 we prepared to come home.
<lb/>We got everything together and started back to the boardwalk. We had had a fine
<lb/>day, we all felt. Then we happened to look at a clock in one of the buildings.
<lb/>It said 3:30, Harry asked a cop what time it was. It was 3:30. Harry's watch
<lb/>was two hours fast, Harry's watch which always had kept the right time down to
<lb/>the last second,,,,We went back to the sand,,,Â«This Thursday was Amiversaxy Day,
<lb/>you know, Sund^ School parade day, Kenneth and Joan will march on Ocean Avenue,
<lb/>Joan will march as a Girl Scout, but Kenneth will march as a plain civilian , He
<lb/>is through tcLth the Cu.b Scouts, He is now twelve years old. He says he does not
<lb/>want to become a Boy Scout, He sas^ he'wants to be free to do as he pleases on
<lb/>Friday nights. He likes freedom, I think Joey is goingt o be like that too,
<lb/>Joey does not like to be ordered. The more you order Joey, the more he resists.
<lb/>If he were in the fcmy, he'd be in the gu.ai*dhouEe,., .There is going to be a conflict
<lb/>in this country, a conflict between fiat and freedom.... I can hear Joey on the
<pb n="96" facs="#page-095"/>
<lb/>porch. He is yelling a peculiar yell he has. It's a combination siren and
<lb/>barshee's wail. He says it's a trolley car. He pushes a block of wood on the ledge
<lb/>of the porch and SB^yrnxMafexnat yells. He gives this yell at all times. One day
<lb/>Joe had him on the Circle of the College, between 21st a nd 22nd Street, He was
<lb/>giving his trolley car yell. I was in ny room and I could hear him.
<lb/>Victor Saturday ffey 20, 19HI4
<lb/>In order to ke^ Dennis from wandering off lÂ£&gt;la got sonÂ® lumber for a fence,
<lb/>Â¥e are going to close in the yard on the Pollards* side with pickets and a gate.
<lb/>This will serve to keep Linda and Joey from wandering off too, I hope, I say I
<lb/>hope because Idon'^ know how strong their habits are. They have been playing in
<lb/>the front so imichi I hope it works. The yard is much better and safer. We may
<lb/>have to add some attraction to keep Linda and Joey in the yard,,.,Right now I
<lb/>hear Joey crying downstairs. From what I can hesr the|r are tiylng to fit on him
<lb/>a new coat. They are telling him to keep his am still. I hear IrDjn laughing. Lucile
<lb/>and Grace are laughing tooe...I hear Stella and Linda, They have just arrived,
<lb/>I can hear Linda bouncing a ball, Stella and Grace are discussing a mirror. They
<lb/>have found a mirror up in the attic xdiich Grace is going to use in her new
<lb/>apartment. They are also discussing a table aid lamp. They are in your old mom,
<lb/>I just heard Grace day that sh0"doubts if Cfeorgiewill want this Linda is
<lb/>asking Lucile if Joey can ride his "bike'.' She means his tricycle .Harry
<lb/>got Kenneili a locker ab Brighton, Joan wanted a locker, too. One day this week
<lb/>she asked me to phone the place to inquire about women's lockers, Grace wasn't
<lb/>here. The man who answered the phone told me that all lockers are taken,
<lb/>Joan will have to do what she did last year. She will haev to wear her bathing
<lb/>suit under her dress.
<lb/>Victor Saturday May 27,
<lb/>Joe finished the fence m the back yard last Sund^. I got some paint for it,
<lb/>but I have been unab3e to apply it. It has been drizzling and raining allweek,
<lb/>...bliat I want to tackle nracb are the stpes in front. You know they were awlways
<lb/>loose. The baby carriages did it...It would be good if we could mdce screens for
<lb/>the porch. We'd need to enclose only the section in front of t^ parlor windows,
<lb/>...I keep on working as usual, I have to pay back Joe and Harry, I suppose I'll
<lb/>have to do it in instalments,...I haven't notified anyone about Papa. Of course
<lb/>there was no will. I think in such a case the house goes half to %ma and half
<lb/>to ali. the children. I'm not sure. There must be a question of inheritance tax.
<lb/>That's why I haven' done a nything about it. However, ELI have to take care of
<lb/>the matter eventually. I suppose there'll be papers for all of us to sign,,..
<lb/>I suppose tomorrow, Sunday, we'll go to Brighton Becah to have our pictures taken
<lb/>for our season passes, Kenneth has beenwanting to go for the past month to get
<lb/>it over with. Something or other has always turned up to prevent it,
<lb/>Victor Saturday June 2ii, 19liii (his birthday)
<lb/>Hero at home everything is the same. Last Sunday we went to Coney Island,
<lb/>Harry, Kenneth, Linda, Joe, Joey and I, We went on the ffeny-go-Bound, Ferris
<lb/>Wheel and Scooter, We had frozen custard and chewing gum...Joey and Linda have
<lb/>just come into my room. They want to punch the keys of the typewriter. Now
<lb/>they are gone again. I hear them in the yard. They flit about like butterflies,
<lb/>hem one moment, gone ihe next. Neither Linda nor Joey understand death. To them
<lb/>^'apa is away. However, they sense something, Joey refers to Papa as "Poor Papa'.'
<pb n="97" facs="#page-096"/>
<lb/>The adjective is his own. No one else has ever used it. .Kenneth has gone to
<lb/>visit a friend. Joan has fone downtown with a friend. Joan has just phoned from
<lb/>downtown to say that she is going to the movies. These two kids have grown
<lb/>up, haven't they?.,,,^'^ama and Grace went to visit Papa's grave last Sunday,
<lb/>The ground has not yet set. However, when we are ready to put up a stone the
<lb/>cemetery will supply a foundation.
<lb/>Victor Saturday July 1, Igliij.
<lb/>We are going to the beach in Harry's car tomorrow. I am sure it will be a
<lb/>nice day. Today is very clear and dry, I don't know if Joey will be abib to go.
<lb/>He is sick today. They aer going to give him milk of magnesia. He is in bedo
<lb/>...Lola is here with Dennis, I can hear him in the backyard. Since Joey is in
<lb/>bed, he has only Linda to play with today,...Both Joan and Kenneth were promoted,
<lb/>Kenneth will go into 7A. I thihk Joan into 6a,..Linda is in Joey's room talking
<lb/>to him. He may be all right tomorrow, I hope he is,,,. Joey is asking for food,
<lb/>I felt his forehead, I don't think he has any fever I was in the kitchen the
<lb/>other day wearing Papa's bathrobe. Linda saw She said, "Papa doesn't live
<lb/>here anymore. That's why you are wearing his bathrobey
<lb/>Victor Friday August 11, 19iiii
<lb/>Todp,^ has been the hottest day of the year.. .Kenneth came over early this
<lb/>morning.' He wanted to go to the beach. We went. What a dayl TJrie sand was so hot
<lb/>we could hardly walk on it. We had to run a few feet from shady spot to shady
<lb/>spot. When I say shady spots I mean the bits of shadow cast by trash cans and
<lb/>beach chairs. It was the only way we could reach the water without burning off
<lb/>the soles of ourfeet, I worÂ© a cotton hat even in the water. It was the first
<lb/>time I have ever done this Kenneth has become a great st-drnmer. He has a
<lb/>beautiful overhand stroke, and he goes very fast, Astranger atlhe beach today
<lb/>commented on this. He pointed Kenneth out to two persons withliim. He even asked
<lb/>Kenneth to swim past them so they could observe his stroke. La^er I asked Kenneth
<lb/>to swim vrith me as far as he could. We swam a distance of about from here to
<lb/>Bedford Avenue, perhaps longer. Yes, Kennefh is going to be a great swimmer,,..
<lb/>Every Tuesday tliewhole gang goes down to BrightonÂ® We have made it a sort of
<lb/>habit. We take luxich and make a day of it...It is 7:30 P.M. Joey is in tte bath
<lb/>room getting ready for bed. He has just yelled into my room as he passed my
<lb/>door. "Good night, Vic" he yelled. Lucile is trying to wash his face and hands.
<lb/>Joey is squirming and laughing. We all call Joey "Joseph^ and big Joe is "Joe'.'
<lb/>1 always s^ "Joey" to you in my letters because, otherwise, you might not
<lb/>know whom 1 meant....Joseph is laughing to beat the band. I have just got up
<lb/>to see why. He fees: is squirting Ì xater on Joe....Last Saturday 1 went to the
<lb/>beach with Joan and Kenneth, 'frJhen we got there Joan started to feel sick. She
<lb/>vomited on the sidewalk, 1 had to send her home. 1 phoned Grace to meet her at
<lb/>the Avenue H station. They gave her a physic that night. Joan was okay the next day.
<lb/>Nana Monday Sept. h, 19UU (trans)
<lb/>It is now four months since Papa left us and yet his presence, his memory,
<lb/>do not abandon us. Almost every night 1 dream about him and Victor says the same
<lb/>is true with him; and lately, in his dreams, Victor says P^a has come back
<lb/>Healthy and well. The other night I awoke and heard very clearly (Papa) saying
<pb n="98" facs="#page-097"/>
<lb/>to me in a low voice, (like wMsperimg) "Leliai' to tell me some
<lb/>thing, which I couldn't remember upon awakening. Little Joe frequently asks
<lb/>"When is Papa coming bac|:? Is he all right now?'.'
<lb/>Victor October 20, 19iilt
<lb/>I can hear Joseph talkingto himself in bed. He asked me a moment ago if it
<lb/>had stopped raining so I could go to New York....Joseph is very bright, too.
<lb/>It seems we all have high I.Q.'s. Joseph can read all the letters from a to z.
<lb/>He can write his name JOE. The other day he amazed all of us by counting
<lb/>backwards from 20 tp 1, He did this on his own initiative, No one had told him
<lb/>to do it. It won't be long before he can tell the time. He can read all the
<lb/>numbers on the clock. When it's ii:30, for instance, he says Uââ6
<lb/>( eferring to FDR, Victor says: Well, the guy got scared. Now he is going to
<lb/>give a few canpaign speeches. He had thought, along that it was in the bag.
<lb/>He wasn't going to "campaign in the usual partisan sense*.' The reports of his
<lb/>stooges, however, filled him with the fear of Jehovah, Sunday Harry,
<lb/>Kenneth and I are going to J&amp;disom Square Garden to see the Rodeo, .P.S,..Mama
<lb/>wants me to add the following. It was fram a letter Albert sent to Laura. "George
<lb/>sent me a V-mail which I received today. He said he was so happy to hear Iwas
<lb/>all right in spite of the terrible conditions. The way he put it down on paper
<lb/>is very iiroressive and touched me a lot. He is a swell boy. Just like the rest
<lb/>of the family. Always more concerned about someone else than of themselvesâ¢
<lb/>I only wish I'm half good as any of them','
<lb/>Victor Saturday Dec, 9, 19iiii
<lb/>The last of the old tree in front is gone. This morning, -vhile we were at
<lb/>breakfast, a derrick came along and pulled the stump out roots and all. Lucile
<lb/>happened to see it from the second floor and she called down to Mama and me in the
<lb/>kitchen. Now there is a gaping fox-hole where the old tree used to be. We'll
<lb/>have to steak dirt from the yard to fill it,. .Linda is downstairs. She is playing
<lb/>with Joseph. Kenneth was here a while ago but has gone home now. It was he who
<lb/>brought Linda over. Stella will ne here later Yesterday, no, it was Thursday,
<lb/>Lucile took Joseph downtown, Joseph spoke with Santa Glaus in one of the big
<lb/>stores, Theh, later, he saw another Santa Glaus somewhere. He told me he saw
<lb/>two of them The kids have a habit of sliding down the stairs head first,
<lb/>believe it or not. They are doing it now. I keep telling Jihem that they are
<lb/>going to get hurt but it's no use. They keep right on.
<lb/>Victor Sunday Ian, 28, 19k$
<lb/>I'm writing this letter in Kenneth's room. Kenneth and Linda are here wij^h
<lb/>me, Harry and Stella have gone to the Hockey game. They are going to meetsome
<lb/>friends there. They will have supper in New York and return about 10:00 P.M.
<lb/>Joe has recovered. He gets up in his room during the day to sit by the window
<lb/>wheh the sun is shining. He hasn't gone downstairs yet, I suppose he TifiLl go
<lb/>down during the week if the weather gets warmer...Last Sunday Harry, Kenneth,
<lb/>Linda and I went to Prospect Park with sleds, Kenneth, Linda and I coasted down
<lb/>the big hills there. We had a good time. There were many people there... .Things
<lb/>are getting pretty bad here, Mamahas not been ableto get any kerosens this week.
<pb n="99" facs="#page-098"/>
<lb/>even in the manner in which she has been getting it. This morning an order
<lb/>was issued here in New York stopping all coal deliveries to schoolsj colleges,
<lb/>libraries and museums. There has been practically no meat for Tfeeks, The papers
<lb/>say that next week there will be no fruit, vegetables, eggs or newsprint here in
<lb/>New York. l&gt;fema could not get more than one bottle of milk yesterday, A complete
<lb/>embargo has been placed on the railroads hare in the East, The country is gradually
<lb/>dying down,, like a clock that needs winding. Moi^over,as things get worse, so do
<lb/>the politicians. They blme everybody and everything but themselves, and turn the
<lb/>screws down on us a little tighter,..The ration point system is breaking down,
<lb/>^feny times the shopkeepers do not bother to collect the points required. The
<lb/>reason for this is that most people have no points left. By the end of the first
<lb/>week of the month most people have used iip all of their points that were supposed
<lb/>to last them for the month. They ha?e used up these points in order to get a
<lb/>bare minimum of the food required to keep body and soul together. .Well, George,
<lb/>Linda goes to school a week froip tomorrow. Stella got the notice from 152.
<lb/>Linda is going into ffi.ss Warner s Kindergarten.
<lb/>Victor March 30, 19ii5
<lb/>Joseph got his hair cut. You don't know the ndiole story a bout this. For
<lb/>months, for almost a year, he had refused to go even near a barber shop. His
<lb/>hair got so that it rippled in beautiful curls down over his ears. People in the
<lb/>street would ask if he be (sic) a boy or a girl. So much was said about his
<lb/>hair, and so many attenpts were made to get him into a barber shop, that hair-
<lb/>cutting had become a phobia with him. Finally, Joe and Grace made another attenrot
<lb/>one evening. They took him down to Flatbush Avenue, to a barber shop around the
<lb/>corner from Glenwood Road. Well, Joseph got his hair cut, and Joe got a black
<lb/>eye and scratched face... .Joseph now gets ice cream con^, comic books and toys,
<lb/>he is going to the circus, t00o...I dust heard Joseph downstairs. He has come in
<lb/>running. Ì  is yelling that he has just got new shoes. He has just returned fiX)m
<lb/>a store with Lucile. He is getting ready for the Easter Parade,
<lb/>Victor Friday Sept, IJ4, 19hS
<lb/>(He mentions tliat it is raining torrentially, and that it was; exactly one
<lb/>year before that the trees^had blown down) The rain was coming down in buckets.
<lb/>When I got back from Laura s about 10:00 P.M. I found our whole front blocked by
<lb/>the trees which had fallen. Mfeia was ciying in the kitchen. Joseph was struggling
<lb/>with Lucile, He wanted to go out and have a look at things. Joe and Alfred came
<lb/>up from the cellar saying that the water there was up to their waists and rising
<lb/>fast. They thought thewiter pipe had burst, I had to laugh. The whole situation
<lb/>was something over which we had no control whatever, an Act of God, as they call
<lb/>it. No one could blai;Â© us now, not even the old man next door, I thought of that
<lb/>and I had to laugh,...This tonight, however, is no hurricane. It is letting up
<lb/>now. The corner on East 21st Street is flooded. You know what that is,.,.I have
<lb/>just finished supper. It has now stopped raining again, for good, I hope, ffema,
<lb/>Lucile and Tony a re still eating, Joe has finished. He's in the parlor reading
<lb/>Joseph the comic books, a nightly session, Dennis is here and there at different
<lb/>things. Sometimes he listens to the comics too, but he does not know what they
<lb/>are all about. One of his favorite pastimes is running at full speed and throwing
<lb/>himself on the couch. This moves the couch a bit, scratching it along the floor,
<lb/>Joseph does this too. It is not good for the couch and it is not g)od for the
<lb/>floor. All of ts tell them not to do it, they aIways say okay and then do it
<lb/>again,..,Yesterday, whwn we were at the beach, Joseph found a dead crab. He in
<lb/>sisted on bringing it home. He said he wanted to make a little cage for it, I
<pb n="100" facs="#page-099"/>
<lb/>thought of Huckleberry Finn, arid I said okay. He put it in his sandpail,
<lb/>and brought it home, I knew it woxild go into the garbage pail as soon as the
<lb/>novelty wore off. As it happened, it went there sooner than I had thought
<lb/>because the odor was so intensely disagreeable. Joe later had to take it
<lb/>wrapped up in paper and throw it down the sewer.
<lb/>(To fill up the page...in George s Itr to me of Oct. 2h, 1991, he mentions that a
<lb/>Wild West tent show used to come to the area later filled by Bixooklyn College, and the
<lb/>Icids, being from the immediate area, got chummy with some of the performers, anong them
<lb/>A David Flying Heels, trick rider. ; Ì
<lb/>Now, there is another anecdote involving Flying Heels that I'm pretty sdre Ì ma never
<lb/>Related to you, with understandable good reason. Hcwever, I think Icanagreemth you
<lb/>that there really isn't any story that should be suppressed. So, at the risk of bringing
<lb/>A curse on my head, or causing Mama to stir in her grave, here goes. As I have mentioned,
<lb/>Ijavid Fkying Heils was- a full-blooded Indian from a tribe in S, Dakota, possibly the
<lb/>Sioux tribe), I would say he was at ttiat time in his mid-20's. He was very popular and
<lb/>^do friends with all us kids in the neighborhood. Among them was Lucile who must have
<lb/>been about 16 or 17 at the time, I believe. Flying Heels seems to have taken a shine
<lb/>on Lu and spent much of his free time around her, 'balking, showing her favors, some-
<lb/>iiimes coming over to 2I1).| to see Lu, His attentions were apprecia-ted by her, for she
<lb/>i^ps flattered in a typical adolescent way. Before long the situation became a bit
<lb/>serious, and when the day came for the Rodeo t o move on (perhaps to South Dakota, who
<lb/>}?nows?) it appeared that Lu rai^it run off with Flying Heels. That's when Jfema really
<lb/>stepped in, I was 8 or 9 at the time, I remember that this particular day Nfema took
<lb/>Lucile into that big room on the second floor, in the middle of the floor, and closed
<lb/>â bhÂ® door, I â was only a little kid and I don't really know what went on in that room,
<lb/>%ybe Grace knows. It is obvious to me that I^ma went about putting some sense into
<lb/>|ai's head trith talk and common sense, no blows whatever, persuasi-Te talk. Of
<lb/>course Lu â was crying and whining al thraugh the scene and^!l^(an remember hearing f rora
<lb/>our position in the hall was Lu moaning over and over again? " Le amo...le amo and
<lb/>Cpntimial sobbing, I have no idea how long the closed session lasted.,.maybe an hour
<lb/>or so, but in the end it was e'vident that Mama had succeeded in getting Lu to see
<lb/>^|i8 light, beca-use David Flying Heels left town â with the show but without Lu following
<lb/>In time of course she got over her remorse and the â whole affair -was forgotten,
<lb/>as so often happens with teenage iiifat-uations, If Mama had not prevailed, a different
<lb/>llAstory would have resulted, your mother and father would not have subsequently met
<lb/>Â©achother, and you would nob have seen the light of day. So, once again, we see an
<lb/>Â©pcample of Maiiia's td-sdom and moral strength. In Lu's own words? "Some gal, our Mother','
<lb/>This is the way I ha-ve alwaya understood the circums-bances, But then a^in I
<lb/>vfas only a little kid at'lhe -bime arsi no one ever discussed the matter â with rne since
<lb/>â then. Maybe Grace knows tfB story differently, Mfeybe she can confirm my account, or
<lb/>add to it, or correct it or negate it entirelyj I don't know.In any case the o'vent
<lb/>(whatever happened) took place over a matter of about tenchys, ended with everything
<lb/>SS it was before the Rodeo ever came, â sri.th no discernible after-effects whatsoever.

<lb/>pictures, Xn both of them you look very well, especially in the om wher^ you are
<lb/>with Ann on the other eide (3), It was a good idea to take it like that, ftie day

<lb/>Papa is still undsr the doctor's mrÂ®| today hÂ® finislisd the medieines
<lb/>prescribed for him last Monday, and tomorrow the doctor will see him again.
<lb/>All this TOek I've ii^isted tlÂ®b he not come downsteira at a3.1, and ha has
<lb/>only gotten out of bed to go to the bathroom, I've taken iH his meals up to hin,
<lb/>m d his legs ere now coirplotely tmswollen. Ho has had to take h or $ iraedicinss
<lb/>at the same time. Now I think I should tell you the whole story (1) about tlds
<lb/>illness of PapÂ® e, which ha has been &lt;tealing with for about savÂ®i years. When
<lb/>it bepuj and ha started having serious gyriytoHS, it tos in the sumtwr Â©f 1937,
<lb/>wSÂ»R Dr. Leonhardt toÂ® on vacation} he always closes his office for more than
<lb/>two nranthÂ®. So, Pspa went with Come jo's wife to their doctor, who diagnosed
<lb/>his illmss as diabetes, (I don't know whether you rmmnber all this.) Then,
<lb/>later. Papa starEetTwnsulting some doctors at the Ì wdish Hospital, where ha
<lb/>used to go regularly with there they tald him wlmt he had was neuritisÂ«
<lb/>So it TOnt untH after some months we went, finally, to see I^, LeoHEa'rd't,'
<lb/>X reiiMiber vesy well that ri#t from the first time Br, L, examined Papa aM
<lb/>saw the results of the upinalysis, hÂ® eald that I^pa's kidiwye were in very
<lb/>bad shape, Arad, among other things, he told Paj)s,s "If I knew that you warÂ© a
<lb/>booae hound, I could understand the asnditi&amp;i of your kidneys 2 I realise that
<lb/>I didn't put t o and tro together and I coulctoSt understand idxy Dr.
<lb/>L. had saW th^. Scarietime later, when :^pa had a reeuwence of tJie swelJjLng,
<lb/>etc,, talking with Victor about what the dootor had said the first time ha
<lb/>eocamimd Papa, Victor came igj with thB origins of this illness of Papa's,
<lb/>vdiich has torvMitad ug for such a long tiroa, I don't Imow whether you recall
<lb/>that back around 1935 &amp; 1936Bapa used to go frequently (it could have been a
<lb/>year or more) to ComÂ©jo's, allegedly to work on an invention ihst was gping
<lb/>"to itake a forbunÂ© fear them'i then, I don't know whether you also knew at
<lb/>that tijtÂ® that Comejo is a drinker (2) In that period. Papa often told me, as
<lb/>an exainple of thÂ® esteem in liiich Come jo held him, that Come jo alwaye had a
<pb n="108" facs="#page-107"/>
<lb/>glass of good liquor imitlng for I^|Â». Them arÂ® many pQople balievÂ® that
<lb/>alcohol 1Â« goal for thÂ® eyÂ®t@jn (3) and ComÂ®jo thought ttot he was doing Papa
<lb/>a gredi favorÂ» It couldn't have bem a amall quantity that I^a drank (li), at
<lb/>the tiiTia hews about 65 or 66 yaare old, and to start putting strong dri^ into
<lb/>one's Ì stesi at thst agÂ®, Â®vÂ«n if it Imd been but an ounce a d^, must have
<lb/>affected his IdLdnayÂ®, Ifeybe it wouldn't have been so bad for him if he had
<lb/>just one time taken a whole lot, even to the point of getting drunk, but to
<lb/>systeiBaticsally put alcohol into one's body over a long tlica Kust have had an
<lb/>atrocious effect, given hia age, I haven't the slightest doubt of this, and
<lb/>I csursÂ® a toousand tisKJs this friendahip of Papa's witti Come jo. Despite all
<lb/>this, Rspa still says Gorasjo is the best friend he has. Recently,'^after seeing
<lb/>Pspa upstairs, has told us again in living room, Qmeo, La and m, "If I
<lb/>knew hÂ® was a drinldjig mm.M I could uÂ»J;erstand the state of his kidneys, Thi.s

<lb/>written a book about kidney disorders Ì ve hie opinions. Exactly Papa's
<lb/>i^TBptarÂ®! (6) It said tl^rÂ® that genea^Uy disorders of the kldifieyg start with
<lb/>some disorder in liver. Well, hare mms the story of srasething that also
<lb/>happened at that tinÂ® and which none of (7)^ dwpite its gravity and
<lb/>its eoOTcquencas it had, One day PapÂ® came d mn to the kitch&lt;ra jtat livid with

<lb/>bit as chatty as Linda (8) ), Imd jmt told him that T%Tiita had told her "Papa

<lb/>part was that hÂ® couldn't spÂ«3ic frwnkly to f%rtdta about it, accusing her and

<lb/>Dear Linda:
<lb/>I Tfjas very glad to get your letter of Aug. 27th, if for no other reason
<lb/>than that I now have your current address. I sent you the stuff included and
<lb/>as you can see, it came vack a while later. So now you have a copy of that
<lb/>really fascinating letter of my mother's of your own. In this mailing
<lb/>I'm including some other goodies, including a Itr your Mother wrote George
<lb/>at the time which I'm sure will interest you. Plus some other goodies I had
<lb/>left over from my xeroxing trips, which should interest Chris,
<lb/>I was also glad to learn that he had received that stuff Is ent as I Reared
<lb/>that it may have been lost in what now passes for the mails. Naturally it's
<lb/>a source of content,ent to me that he is so interested in genealogy and family
<lb/>anecdotes. Genealogy Ì  interesting, in part because, as I believe, so many
<lb/>personality traits are genetically linked, and I've aSrways found it interesting
<lb/>to see this or that peculiarity reproduced in later generations who never met
<lb/>some of the priginals personally. The good and tha not so good, a daunting
<lb/>prospect, Que sera, sera. If you remeittoer to when you next write, send me
<lb/>Chris' address so I can bombard him with genealogical details. If he doesn't
<lb/>answer, finej I can understand how initially uncomfortable it can be to
<lb/>encourage correspondence from some whacko first cousin once removed, but I'm
<lb/>the last to know many of these "fascir^tin"' stories, and iry eccentricities
<lb/>may raise euebrows, but are seldom boring, especially if one has an interest
<lb/>in such arcane matters,
<lb/>I was glad, as I said in last, enclosed and delayed, Itr that you all
<lb/>had a chance to get to know eachother some time back, at Ken s. Living so close
<lb/>and all, it's a shame that there should have been no contact until recently.
<lb/>And, I know that it would have gladdened Nana s heart, which is I guess the
<lb/>reason I'm sorting out all this stuff when all is said and done.
<lb/>Grandmother Linda! Â¥ow,' You must be beaming, and I hope to see a
<lb/>picture of the little being who has had the temerity of putting you into
<lb/>another generation. I wouldn't worry too much about there not being too much
<lb/>money therej it's a bummer, of course, but one must do his or her own thing,
<lb/>and the lack of money hasn't prevented many of us from being splendid people,
<lb/>I'm sure they'll be fine.
<lb/>]y^ health is ffisne, as I wrote earlier, to the disbelief of all professionals.
<lb/>I've started taking an experimental drug called ddc, an antiviral like AZT
<lb/>which I couldn't handle (made me tired, bloated and gaseous. I'm one of those
<lb/>who have few syngjtoras (so far) and we'll see whether I have any adverse reactions
<lb/>to it; I just srated it the other day, I siirply refuse to worry about it all,
<lb/>que sera, sera anaall tb^, and I think my attitude is the best one can have.
<lb/>Full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes. Perhaps the worst part of it for me has
<lb/>been the loss of somany friends, but this would have been my lot had I been bom
<lb/>a generation sooner and had to Ì o off to WW II, As Gilda Ratner would have said,
<lb/>it's always something,
<lb/>Basta, I have to go watch Gorbachev and Yeltsin on Nightline, so I'll close
<lb/>for the mo, I'll write more detainedly later,,,.a threat.

<lb/>Dear Ken, Eliza, Linda, Jim, at alt
<lb/>Excuse the rudeness of sending a generally addressed massiva missive, but
<lb/>the xeroix place is closed and it saves time. Excuse also please tlw tacky
<lb/>listing att the bottoraj I do this so I can remember what I 've sent and to whom,
<lb/>which helps to prevent duplication, rdiw that I've reached the age where I forget
<lb/>what I've said or written, despite keeping copies of my Itrs.
<lb/>If you (all) found the letter from Mother interesting, you should get
<lb/>a few giggles from the enclosed. Ken might even remember some of the incidents
<lb/>recounted! Joan did and roared. Since so much of ail this concerns us as kids,
<lb/>I find it very engrossii^, and only wish I could renÂ»mber some of the incidents
<lb/>myself. I remember some, but it's fascinating, and frequently funny, to see
<lb/>the story with all the details fleshed out. Ana Nana's letters are a joy to read.
<lb/>Fun to translate, too. obviously, most of the Itrs are about honÂ©y things and
<lb/>would be too tedious to quote in full, so I just excerpted the nmty parts.
<lb/>The Ecuadorian stuff, arcane, is merely to fill in details| it's interesting
<lb/>to look at ancestral faces and find familiar traits,(I think I already sent these
<lb/>to Linda a while back.) The picture of Nana, Papa &amp; Victor is inscribed as quoted
<lb/>in Nana's hand, giving the date, which she always said was a habit morepeople should
<lb/>engage in (identifying), and the inscription on Nana's portrait is in Papa's hand.
<lb/>Stella's Itr is the copy Georgessnt me of hii^ originalj I rexeroxed it 2 sheets
<lb/>to a page to fit in my records better, Nana s Itrs were handwritten! one of them
<lb/>reaches ten pages, ti^tly spaced, too. We dre truljr an epistolary breed.
<lb/>I am well, nothing new to report on the health scene, I've bÂ®n taking this
<lb/>experimental drug, an antiviral ckLled ddc (Not the ddi they just approved because
<lb/>the dr says that s bad for one) and have found none of the annoying side effects
<lb/>that AZT caused ifte. So I'm fine. The vision is better ( typos notwithstanding) aixi
<lb/>everybody says I look s splendid, so who am I to argue? Appetite is goodj in fact,
<lb/>I'm in the process of cooking turkey (wings &amp; thighs, rutabaga, red pepper, etc.) &amp;
<lb/>a friend is coming over for the feast, so I'll close here with irgr best to you all
<lb/>and fond recollections of all those other turk^ feeds of yore.

<lb/>I know the date of the picture rro:n otlior enanshnts taken the saaie
<lb/>dayj this is, of course, in the yard at 21ll(, in the winter. It really
<lb/>captures Grace, and inay be- the first picture of the faiiious pompadour whicli
<lb/>she \TOre til the day she died, somewhat ttiiiLuor But otill riiainly black,
<lb/>A couple of years back the doctors diagiiosed Grace with multiple myeloma,
<lb/>a marrox-j cancer, which shov;ed xxp in a blood test. Grace wasn't told, and the
<lb/>doctors told Joan that chemotlierapy or radiation wouldn't really do more
<lb/>than makeH her last years miserable, and that she'd probably die before
<lb/>tiie cancer Isecamc a real probleit;, of old ayo, etc. 3ho pi^obai'ly knew, thoufii,
<lb/>as people always do, but never ;iieritioned it. She got around the apartment in
<lb/>a vxhoelchair, due to the osteoporosis she also Ixaa in one leg, and when
<lb/>someone helped her in and out of the clialr, she would say "Don't hold me under
<lb/>the arms, my arthritis hurts"; by tliis tine, it was probably affecting the
<lb/>lymph nodes, but it was artliritis and that vas that. She had a brace for her
<lb/>leg, wiiich slio wouldn't wear (l) and some })rol.'lems with a crossed toe, so
<lb/>she just preferred to use the whcolrhair, spending most of her time in it or
<lb/>In bed, watching tv and reading the newrspaper.
<lb/>Recently, she stopped doing that and just stayed in bed. Joan or one of
<lb/>the kids noticed that Grace's eyes looked strange, and then one day Joan came
<lb/>home from work and found Grace in the bathroom, on the toilet, somearhat
<lb/>disoriented. She asked Joan what tine it was and Joan said "it's seven'.' Grace
<lb/>asked "horning or nighttime?!,' so she Ixad probably been there all day. They
<lb/>took her to the doctor, Dirt he found Gracx; to lie holding her own and a.'uioyed
<lb/>at being stuck witli ncodlofj for blood toots, etc., so she came back home.
<lb/>The Sunday she died, she liad bioen tailing with lier Jh'aiidson-in-law Tomip/

<lb/>7/30/92 Hi: Got the pictures, thanks. You look and sound â well, and
<lb/>Rebecca is very cute. Casey takes after Jim's side, I guess, but Nancy
<lb/>reminds me of you.
<lb/>Had a nice time with Bob, etc. Joan â was going to come up and sxirprise
<lb/>him, but then Grace started failing, but they did speak by phone.
<lb/>Grace â will be cremated and scattered, as they did XfdLth Wally and
<lb/>Lynn. Joan is spending some time at one of the kids' place, and there's talk of
<lb/>a get-together of all the kids (Imay or may not go) to grieve and tell "Nana
<lb/>Grace stories'.' They're all a bit freaked at â the suddenness of it but that will
<lb/>pass. They're fine.
<lb/>Will write more detainedly later on.

<lb/>c'Dear Linda:
<lb/>December l6, 1992
<lb/>,/ Actually, I didn't forget, but I knew a card wouldn't get there in
<lb/>rtime, Jfeny happy returns andoall '^hat plus the usual holiday fa-la-las
<lb/>to you and all'yours and hopes that the coming year will be better,than
<lb/>the last. We al;l deserve better breaks nhw that we're starting to get a
<lb/>-â little long in the toothl - â
<lb/>"  First off, thanks for the pictures you sent along a While back, and
<lb/>which I never^acknowledged (Yeah, Joeyl) Nancy looks like you-and little
<lb/>Rebecca is very cute, with a very alert expression. You look good in the
<lb/>â  Kentucky snapshot5 I can't pick out ..a single'grey hair.:'Kert told me that
<lb/>you'wehe baCk at the shop. Which is good. Urn sure this is being a busy
<lb/>â time, A"few weeksago all you heard was recession, money problems and the
<lb/>like, and how people are buying like-they always have and everybody seems
<lb/>-Tipbeat about spending money. I guess time will tell whether it's boom or
<lb/>1 just still bust. Today in the papers it was IBM that is to close offices
<lb/>and lay people off, and a friend called and mentioned that he had gotten
<lb/>a pink'slip and Was down about it.i I'm more interested in foreign policy
<lb/>than economics' (easier to ubderstand) but it certainly does seem that
<lb/>everything is all screwed up. Curious times.
<lb/>Ken sounded ^ood and up, though.his voice sounded a little thinner^]?
<lb/>which "I remember someone telling ..me after my appendectomy IG'yrs back.
<lb/>"But his .attitude is upbeat and that 's probably'the most important thing.
<lb/>He starts some exercise program next, month, I think and has already made
<lb/>alterations to his diet. He Was very luc^y that he found out'about things
<lb/>earlyish in'the game, .and given the family attitude about health'in
<lb/>rgeneral,"we probably.have Eliza to thank for that, A pity, 'though, that
<lb/>most:'of the good .things rto eat are now taboo. I still cook with butter "and
<lb/>.stuff like that; what hte hell? For,years 'I heard about cholesterol and
<lb/>- then after the strokeoand medical coverage I found Out that my cholesterol
<lb/>level was very low, as was the blood pressure. Must be all.the good'
<lb/>California red wine,: health is g6od, in fact a lot more peppy than it
<lb/>cWas a while back,' some of which I "attribute to these Chinese -herbal tablets
<lb/>"the acupuncturist Recommended, vitamins a la Oriental, I've now had my own
<lb/>run-in with the big C; there was this little black spot on an eyelid that
<lb/>I had removed before it got any bigger and became more problematic to excise.
<lb/>Turned out to be a melanoma, skin cancer caused by too much sun or some
<lb/>thing years back, common as dirt and slow-groxcing and of no concern. But
<lb/>it makes a good story,
<lb/>I had a card from Laura t'other day, which I'm still deciphering; her
<lb/>handwriting is tricky and she rambles on in stream of consciousness style.
<lb/>She sounds content and it is of course certainly a whole lot better than
<lb/>2620 Glenwood. She wears a brace on one wrist I think because of some
<lb/>troubles with arthritis (at least we don't have that gene) and Bob says
<lb/>she complains as do some of the other residents at the home that her
<lb/>things turn up missing, blouses and bric-a-brac, which is also claimed
<lb/>by others, so maybe there's a klepto amongst them. Or maybe she's just
<lb/>getting a little funny. It must also be annoying to be older and tell
<lb/>people things and have them say Pish-tush, poo-poo, you're just imagining
<lb/>things, I get some of that now and it makes me livid, I, who am never wrong.
<pb n="120" facs="#page-119"/>
<lb/>No one seems to have heard anything from Dennis. I wrote him when
<lb/>Grace died, but so far no answer. I hope he's ok. I'd imagine-from what
<lb/>he said to me after the '89 earthquake that Tony has gone on to his
<lb/>reward by now. Joan is fine,adjusted to the new circumstancesj she
<lb/>i:changed apartihehts in'the same complex, Ìand that'helped. She w as-having
<lb/>some lower vack problems, aches, etc, which she attributed to getting-too
<lb/>fat. She should "probably do some exercise stuff too.She's now concerned
<lb/>nwith her son Walter^ about 29 now, who has married a"girl Joan hates. One
<lb/>of the other sons is married with two kids and one .'on the way j sometime
<lb/>'baqkohe found Jesus, as they say, -and that- can be-tiresome,t but it seems
<lb/>'"to Have straightened him out. Bbb lives with" one of the sons in Arizona
<lb/>and they all got together for his 6"Gth-birthdayj he Js-lin ..so-sb shape,
<lb/>â  problems with diabetes and the effects of years of smpking and drinking
<lb/>too much, rather like an old guard dog that's lost his teeth and bark.
<lb/>I had "a call from Olga a while back, who was-visiting her sonc&amp; dtr
<lb/>"in I think Wanda put her up to it. Was nice speaking with her;-it tas
<lb/>-been prdbably 20 yrs. She sounds so youthful, still a light bell-like voice.
<lb/>'.cEnid has been-'havihg terrible headaches that no dr seems to be able to do
<lb/>much about; migraines "or something". Wanda says ULi and Bea have left Long
<lb/>olsland for Virginia, I think, to be closer to their dtr'Elizabeth. - -
<lb/>I got a snapshot of Georgianh"and her three-kids at- the -HSograduation
<lb/>of her youngest, Jennifer, and like you do; she looks' well and quite
<lb/>youthful,. not a sign of grey. I must write George'and ask about any
<lb/>possible damage-in this recent weather business they had up there.o
<lb/>A while back at a dinner party I met a guy. 8 yrs younger, â  who Lwas
<lb/>-'raised in-Flatbush and also went to :152, Hudde and-Mdwood. I recognized
<lb/>-  the accent; he grew up in one of ""those apt bldgs oh Ocean near Farragut,
<lb/>sidei We, must have bored wveryone else there to distraction,- and-we
<lb/>- just couldn't recall .the- name of A1 ,- whm had the schoolbus business
<lb/>at 1^2. We neveroused them, but we remembered.the guy. So I took the^
<lb/>bull by the horns and wrote to 1^2,-and actually got a responseJ The nice
<lb/>: lady, school secretary, said it was-Schultz, which i^ of course wrong, but
<lb/>I thought it. was nice that they-responded. On the Iqtterhead they list an
<lb/>annex to 1^2 on Utica-Avenue i That's halfway; out LI I Strange world. '
<lb/>â   I Anyway, I shall go and slip-lhis in the box and then settle- in with
<lb/>a movie. Have'a great holiday; drive-carefully, don't talk-to strangers, etc.

<lb/>Dear Dinda:
<lb/>2/1/93
<lb/>Not too nuch has happened sihce Ilast wrote, except that I did make
<lb/>a New Year's resolution to answer letters more promptly and answer questions
<lb/>such as you wrote. I'm including a copy of this letter so you can send it
<lb/>to Chris and he can know what kind of and how many relatives (2nd cousins)
<lb/>there are on that side. So, then, kids of Joan and Bob.
<lb/>Leslie Carol, b. May 29, 1951, in Falmouth,MA. Sometime in the early '60's
<lb/>after Nana's deat^ Leslie married Tommy Rubano, a few mths short of the
<lb/>birth of her Isl/trd Christine. Tommy is of Itlian descent and lived nearby
<lb/>when Joan was living on E. 23rd near Sears. He worked for Pepsi-Cola and
<lb/>subsequently other similar cort^ianies, filling machines, etc. They moved
<lb/>to Staten Island and there were two more dtfs, ??? and Samantha, who is
<lb/>now about 10 and wants to become a lawyer. Leslie took a degree in
<lb/>nursing and I guess as a result of that, found out that she had a per
<lb/>manent heart condition, nothing serious, but she has to take some pills
<lb/>or whatever daily. Then they moved to S Cal and now live ip/a very nice
<lb/>and rather posh ranch-style house in Temecula; fortunately, it's on a
<lb/>hill, so the recent floods down there didn't affect them. Tommy, who has
<lb/>always been a very steady worker, and is, as Victor said to me when we met
<lb/>the Rubanos, who lived on Flatbush and Cortelyou, "Siitple pec^e but gdce
<lb/>people), had some work-related accident andit left him with back problems
<lb/>wihch had the good aspect of beinging him $1 in compensation. There were
<lb/>also some other suits they brought which they won, I don't know what about.
<lb/>Leslie reminded me, for I saw her for the 1st time in many yrs two yrs ago,
<lb/>a little of your Mother, not physically, but in the sense of "I've been
<lb/>poor and I don't intend to go through that again'.' Things have to be done
<lb/>properly and all that. Despite which her elder dtrs have each had kids
<lb/>not only before marriage but without any thought of it (marriage), thereby
<lb/>making Joan once again a great-grandmother. They're nice people.
<lb/>Karen Lee b. Juna 12, 1952 in B'klyn. In Southern Cal as a youngish
<lb/>woman, maybe early '20's at the oldest Karen married this guy named Phil
<lb/>Stotts, who in S Cal style skydived. I met him once and he was pleasant,
<lb/>though Joan always thought there wasn't too much between the ears. I guess
<lb/>Karen came to the same conclusion, because they got divorced, after the
<lb/>birth of one son, little Phil, who is now about 21, I think, and who has
<lb/>so far rpoduced one little son (again without marriage), making Joan a
<lb/>Great-grandmother again. But I get ahead of myself. Mist be about ten
<lb/>yrs ago Karen remarried, a very nice guy, also divorced, and with a kid
<lb/>who I think 1wes with his mother, named Frank Krai, who is from NYC.
<lb/>He works in computers, I think, and Karen is quite successful as some sort
<lb/>of educational consultant, I believe. They have a verishorae in Mission (-y nice)
<lb/>Viejo, very posh. I keep up with her most, after Joan. There wree no kids.
<lb/>Little Phil, Phil, I suppose, at one point was taking courses ineduca-
<lb/>tion and wanted to be a gym teacher, I thih^but I don't know if that's
<lb/>still true. I've always thought that Karen resembled Wally, whereas all
<lb/>the other kids look like Bob's side.
<lb/>lynn Anne, b. Dec. 13, 1953, B'klyn; died, murdered, about two yrs ago
<lb/>in S Cal. Sad story. Background: at one point lynn "found Jesus" and
<lb/>like all such people, usedto send me short tracts, or talk aboijit Jesus
<lb/>in her Ifaas cards. She got married out here to a guy named Jeff Treganowan,
<pb n="122" facs="#page-121"/>
<lb/>(a Welsh name) who was in the milijyary. They lived up noarth in Petaluma
<lb/>and hems stationed at some base in Iferin County. There was one kid,
<lb/>Josh, now about 21 and living ih S Calj nice ynung man, looks very Hedegard.
<lb/>The m.arraige ended in divorce. Incidentally, lynn develeopd around this
<lb/>time I think, diabetes, for which she used to inject insulin daily; she
<lb/>decided to have her tubes tied so as not to bring any more potentially
<lb/>diabetic kids into the world. She was very like Bob, and would go into
<lb/>rages or snits over things very easily. She just hated Bob, probably because
<lb/>she XiTas so like him. She was very affectionate and fun-loving; never re
<lb/>married, got over Jesus as she got older, but had a few live-in boyfriends.
<lb/>But she was a little crazy, nad used drugs, as half of S Gal does; one night
<lb/>a couple of her fellow crack-using acquaintances decided to commit a robbery
<lb/>to get for crack and they sort of kidnapped her to use her car, lynn was
<lb/>adamantly against it, so one of them quieted her by bludgeoning her to death.
<lb/>They have since been caught and sent to prison, but it took a while and
<lb/>the whole affair was very hard on the rest of the kids, not to mention the
<lb/>effect on poor Joan, No pain is more wrenching or seems more unfair or
<lb/>unnatural as the death of a child, Nana lost U, and I'-femita all her 5 sons
<lb/>before she died, Joan, like them, still has moments, always will, but has
<lb/>continued and found strength somehow. People at work(For the state, I foâ¬get
<lb/>which dep't) knows so when Joangets a "moody they understand.
<lb/>Laura Gail b. 7/27/ 60, B'klyn. First, it shbuld be mentioned that as a
<lb/>result of Bob's own diabetes and gladular imbalances, whjch he inherited
<lb/>from his mtther, whom everybdy seems to hate, there were no kids for 7 yrs,
<lb/>fort^imately, for otherwise thete'd be more. Â¥ally said to me once "They
<lb/>cut too much out add now he can only shoot blanks'.' Sooo IJallyl CMtell, it
<lb/>grew back, and there were 6 more kids, the first Laura Gail, who as a kid
<lb/>was crosseyed(long since corrected). I don't know her or the younger ones
<lb/>as well because they left for S Gal and I for St Louis. Laura married a
<lb/>guy named Daryn ???, whom Joan doesn't like, and they live in Idaho,
<lb/>I believe. Or Arizona, I'm not shre, and I don't know whether there ate kids,
<lb/>Daryn was veiy nice to me when I met him at Leslie's a couple of yrs back,
<lb/>but I was a visiting relative, I think Joan's dislike stems from Daryn's
<lb/>"playing aroundy real or perceived. But he and Laura seems happji. I don't
<lb/>know what he (they) do for work. The Laura part is probably becuase Bob
<lb/>had a sister named Laura,
<lb/>Robert Arne b. May l5j 1961, B'klyn, First, Arne was Bob's father's name.
<lb/>Robert is, I believe, an electrician, is married and has two sons. Haven't
<lb/>met his wife. Tallish, very good,looking, he's the oldest son and has
<lb/>inherited Bob's glandular upsets. If he drinks, he gets crazy, so he
<lb/>doesn't. A very wild childhood, some scrapes with the law for "ptanks"
<lb/>as they'd call it now. But he settled down when he got married, and he and
<lb/>his wife are VERY into Jesus, some sort of Evangelical business. Joan likes
<lb/>the dtr-in-law. They livel think in S Gal.
<lb/>Walter Vincent, b. October 13, 1962, B&amp;klyn, the last born ih NYC, Has
<lb/>also had some scrapes with the law, and is currently also into Jesus.
<lb/>He has phoned me from time to time; Joan says he admires me??? He's a
<lb/>bit wacky, or was, and Joan hates his wife, whom she distrusts for some
<lb/>reason. Walt is okay in small doses. He's the most like Bob. He swears he
<lb/>remembers Nana's wake, which he couldn't as he was only a few mths old at
<lb/>the time. I tned to think he's a bitspiritual, or clairvoyant or something.
<lb/>Works for some sort of place that makes circuit boards for computers.
<pb n="123" facs="#page-122"/>
<lb/>Hoan Marie ("joanie"), b. Tfey 19, 196I|., S Cal. Very nice youQig lady, has
<lb/>a 9 yr old dtr named Carrie^ has for some time lived with a guy also named
<lb/>Tommy who has a successful restaurant specializing in Prime Rib and stuff.
<lb/>They seem quite happy and they're both very nice. Lives in the same apt
<lb/>complex as Joan. Tomir^r and she and Carrie were up here for some restaurant
<lb/>convention, so s e and Carrie came to see me and we wnet to lunch and had
<lb/>a chance to get to kgiow eachother as more than just family. Seems like a
<lb/>good relationship.
<lb/>David Neal b. June 22, 1965, S. Cal. Niceish young man who drinks too much
<lb/>beer. Still sihgle, also works in some sort of circuit board field. I've
<lb/>only seen him once as a grown-up. Just an ordinary guy,
<lb/>JMarian ?? b. 196?, S Cal. Has a 5 yr old or so dfer who Joan feakes care
<lb/>of a lot. Lives with Jlanand formerly Grace. Seems like a giice young lady
<lb/>with maybe a touch of being "hyper'.' Only met her once.
<lb/>So that's them. Joan by the my is a yr and f younger than Ken and
<lb/>like the other ladies of the line still hasno grey ahir. Still smokes
<lb/>too much and means to cut down (Hai) She split from Bob about 5 71*8 ago,
<lb/>and he now lives in Arizona. He is, in Joan's words, a wreck physically,
<lb/>and I think he lives on Social Security, since he can't work. Never could.
<lb/>He has never taken care of himself andis paying the price now. Prank,
<lb/>Karen's husband, commented once that he was impressed at the way the lids
<lb/>all seem tosppport eachother in times of crisis. This one or that one may
<lb/>not always get along, or may nbt be able to stand someone's spouse, but
<lb/>when the chips are down, they're there, I guess growing up in adversity
<lb/>Kan have good long-term effects,
<lb/>A friend of mine also went to NY around Xmas and went to the ^'â¢latisse
<lb/>show. Said there were millions of people, which is how I remegiber NY,
<lb/>A little goes a long way, and to live there you have to earn a fortune.
<lb/>Chatted with Laura Lou yesterdayand she was saying that her kids just
<lb/>can't believe her when she tells them that people didn't lock their doors
<lb/>and that she thought nothing of walking home from baby-sitting at 2 AM.
<lb/>I think if I were to see parts of Brooklyn now, I8d probably have another
<lb/>stroke, I like toiemember it as it was, but that feeling strikesme about
<lb/>SF sometimes.. There was good and there was bad, but now it would be worse
<lb/>and who needs that? They've even changed the BMT and if you get on at
<lb/>Hewkj5ik, you wind up going along 6th Avenue i Probably costs a buÂ«k at
<lb/>least.
<lb/>Oh, I got a xmas card from Dennisj this time he added a note, that
<lb/>he will call me sometime and that Tony is still with us, but "the disease
<lb/>has progressed quite a bit'.'
<lb/>Laura Lou said that Ronnie ("Ron") and Gladys managed to get an
<lb/>adoptive som from Bolivia, It mths old, Matthew Albert. Even with aU the
<lb/>paperwork, ot cost them 3 1 in bribes. Laura was going up to see them this
<lb/>week. Lisa, whom you may never have seen, still lives in B'klyn, way
<lb/>out on Ocean near Ave U, In Manhattan Beach, where in our times there
<lb/>was an abandones military base, that's now a jr college! It do fly,
<lb/>Enuf. I've rambled on too long, but at least this time it wasn't all
<lb/>about me. Take care, love and kisses and all that.
<pb n="124" facs="#page-123"/>
<lb/>Late breaking flashes; A while badk:, Joan says, she was changing Grace's bed
<lb/>while she was in the Htchen and she found, aU cpungsled up and with a rubber
<lb/>band, in Grace's pillowcase. She left it there and said nothing, but after
<lb/>Grace died and Joan wait to spend a few days away from the apartment, she told
<lb/>some of the "kids" not to throw anything away when they cleaned out Grace's room.
<lb/>Tliey came across $ltOOO, that's GRAND, all in little bundles of no more than
<lb/>^00, probably saved from grocery money, who knows? So Grace died on her own
<lb/>terms and her own turf, paid for her expenses and left a legacy to boot.
<lb/>No one can ever say the Razminos aren't colorfulJ The more I think about it
<lb/>the funnier it gets, and I doubt Joan would mind my telling it.
<lb/>Â¥e are ALL weird!

<lb/>Saturday May 8, 1993
<lb/>Dear Chris!
<lb/>Got your missive yesterday and was glad tovread it and finally see where
<lb/>Stella was buried. Since your jyfother told me once that she had only gotten
<lb/>one letter from you while you were in school, so Is houldn't hope for much,
<lb/>I was very honored. But all in all, I was very glad to hearfrom you, I think the
<lb/>last note was when youwere a kid. Sit back, for this is going to be a long
<lb/>one, thpfigh it is typed with one hand (the left); since Iwrote your Mother
<lb/>about two mthsago, I'venhad some health problems, about whivh the following.
<lb/>Around the beginning of Ì '^arch I noticed that I was having trouble writign
<lb/>and speaking, so the dr at^SIl^JArd 86, whivh deals excellenjjly with AIDS
<lb/>patients, diagnoded toxopJCiiosis, for which he prescribed three antibiptics,
<lb/>f-.-C n i-Ttr Cf-\ V-iio t 7-1 4-n/= o^iv^-rTrrT "Pov* rxVc 7^*7^,r7:7-r T rwinone of which did an;;/ good/ so he put me in the hqjital for obser-ration
<lb/>and stuff whicJ/. took several days and they found a lesion on cerebellum
<lb/>(brain) which they thought was PrIL, progres,sive riui3-tiiocal leucoenenceph-
<lb/>alopathy, which is bad, and itawasi/'t; they then diagneded vasculitis, which
<lb/>is a series of small strokes, which makes more sense, but it may not be.
<lb/>The long andshort of it all is that they don't know what it is, which I think
<lb/>is good because it keeps drs humble. But the lack of use of the right hand
<lb/>(it would be the right) and the speech difficulties are continuing andaare
<lb/>a nuisance, Nonejzheless, the mind remains good (l) and I jusy go on, While
<lb/>Iwas in the hospital they discovered beginning GMT' CytomegaloviUBUs), an
<lb/>AIDS complaint which takes away the sight; it was o.nII.y in one eye and every
<lb/>day thejr IV me at home withxEjasararÂ® Foscarnet and saline solution which
<lb/>makes me pee a lot at night. At least Istill wake up firsti I'm tired a lot
<lb/>but I keep going on; after all, there are people worse off than I am and
<lb/>I've been healthy so far, soooo.,,,But enough of me. Let me get to your
<lb/>letter,
<lb/>Felicisirao = Abuelito ("frauds") Francisca Â« Tlamita
<lb/>Victor Manuel Pazinom = Papa lelia Lopez â  Nana
<lb/>Victor Estenio Pazmino =* Victor Dolores Lopez " Lola
<lb/>I tend to use the names Nana di^ so if these are known to you, Excuse,
<lb/>The Lelia Estela Pazmino referred to is of cuorse Stella, She was born
<lb/>at # 6 Agate Cotart, a shortstreet off Atlantic Avenue near Kingston Ave
<lb/>which Nana and Papa lived in at the time, and which even in my day was
<lb/>in a neighborhhod you entered at the risk of your life. Bue because they
<lb/>wree "freethinkers" she wasnT baptized until she was 3, and thereby hangs
<lb/>a tale, Nana, Victor, and I (most stridently) wre anticlerical and non-
<lb/>Catholic, but Lola and Maraita were not, so Nana must have puj up with a
<lb/>lot of crap, until she finally gabe in when her cousin NicolasF, Lopez
<lb/>and his first wife, a Chilean named Adela Punicio, visited Bokk Brooklyn
<lb/>in 190it. By then thejs lived elsewhere, probab5.y on ItLdwood St, Lola was Ste^-la's
<lb/>godmother And NiCol^s her godfather, Nanaremembered the priest saying
<lb/>"Horrors" at theage of the child, just being baptized. As far as i know,
<lb/>Stella was the only one baptized; no, there was Victor, the only one born
<lb/>in Ecuador, whose godfather wsa Eloy Alfaro, A record of that rite was gotten
<lb/>years later when Vcitor got his Naturalization papers.
<pb n="126" facs="#page-125"/>
<lb/>( I just changed the ribbon, so.,,) This, despite or perhaps because of Nana's
<lb/>Father an HIS Father and the priestly background of the Garcia Moreno clan.
<lb/>But STella...Despite having in-laws who wree practicing this or that, Nana
<lb/>was very anti-Catholic, not the individuals butthe institution. She satyed
<lb/>that way until she died at 85, But all of this is from her and from her
<lb/>sisjrer Eloisa, All I'm doing is remembering, as does my cousin Joan, who
<lb/>wre with Nana late in her life. The pictures you see of them show them in
<lb/>old age,afetr a lifetime mf disenchantments. But they all(l only knew the
<lb/>3 sistersand their couisn Tfelvina) had great senses of humor and were always
<lb/>laughing. Ken remembeis Lola as always laughmng at something. And they all
<lb/>especially Nana had great memories. We wree veiy lucky, though we didn't always
<lb/>know it at the time. Your grandmother, Stella, in a letter to George while he
<lb/>was overseas, says "Just so long as Gq(| makes women like our Mother, there is
<lb/>hope for the salvation of thr world'.' m Mother, Lu, more succinctly, writes
<lb/>"Some gal, our Mother? THese wree letters written abmut Papa's death. Your
<lb/>grandfather, Harry Flandreau Disosway, was always spoken of highly by Nana,
<lb/>and thereby lies a tale which I just heard from Joan. Stella worked for
<lb/>a Mrs !fey who had a tearoom in Bedford Stuyvesant(See the picture with Mrs,
<lb/>May's dog) which is where she met Harry^ who used to go there with his
<lb/>parents. She was the cashier. When Harry later on "callegi Nana was happy.
<lb/>Not so regarding someone else who worked there, A Chinese or somethign, who
<lb/>took a shine to Stella, reciprocated. Nana didnTt approve and once failed
<lb/>to give Stella a lejrber from this guy becauseshe didn' like the idea of
<lb/>Stella taking tp with a Chinese. Ordinarily, Nana said she wouldn't have
<lb/>ineterfered b'Sj Funder the circsjunstances..." He went away and Stella forgot
<lb/>about him. i
<lb/>I remember once, musthave been the summer of Ì  '53&gt; ona trip to the
<lb/>gravesites, we went to the abbey at Cypress Hills, nearby, to see the crypts
<lb/>of Harry&amp;s parents, which is i suppose where hewent, I thinkLinda was with
<lb/>Harry and Stella and Harry broke down and cried. Hehad had at least one stroke
<lb/>by this time and was I think thinking of his own demise. Nana exchanged a look
<lb/>with Victor. Harry died in October, I tnink of that year. He was about 10
<lb/>yrs older thsn Stella, and an only child, I remember once when I was about
<lb/>10 or 11 running into Harry on Glenwood Rd, and thinking that he looked weak
<lb/>and aged; I guess he had had the first of his strokes then, but as a kid
<lb/>one didn't notice, and no one spoke of it in front of me, I remembered him
<lb/>from when I was a kid and he used to take us kids forrides in his 38 Dodge,
<lb/>and of course from the xmas dinners. He was nice. He once, whem Stella had
<lb/>-|ut down her foot about something, I don't know what, toTd Victor "Youknow,
<lb/>Stella can be difficult at times'.' I remember that (Victor told me) because
<lb/>it was so unlike him, A Ms Harrison, a teacherat PS 152, remembered your
<lb/>great-grandfatherSs Disosway having a pharmacy, which I remember telling
<lb/>her about(j^ cousiiis) and your uncle Ken, and I think your Mother too,
<lb/>has p photograph of this man and Nana's brother Sam taken on Martense St,
<lb/>While Itnink oh it...Ifertense is Dutch and one of the names of the old
<lb/>Dutch families in Brooklyn. PietersB is for Pieterszoon, a patronymic,
<lb/>and Deventer is a town in Holland near ZwoUe, which has fi famous organ, y Ì
<lb/>It Ì  interesting what discoveries one makes. There was a billboard companjC
<lb/>in NYC named Disosway and StsEh SbscEfcfc Fletcher, I think, who must have
<lb/>been realted, but no oneever investigated it. I only knew of a cousin of
<lb/>Harry's named Katherine Disosway, who lived with Elsa Smithon Plaza St in
<lb/>Brooklyn. There was also an Aunt Lula somewhere down southj your Mother
<lb/>would remember.
<pb n="127" facs="#page-126"/>
<lb/>Before I forget, please give ray fondest regards to your Father the next time
<lb/>you see or speak with him. The enclosed pictures of them I Ìok, as I did
<lb/>those of Stella, which might be the last taken of her. Someplace along the
<lb/>way in the last 30 yrs l8ve lost a box with soem negatives and some prints.
<lb/>Something has to get lost along the way.
<lb/>The pages are from the 1910 census books I^tisfiled and not together, and
<lb/>if one tries very hard, one can make out the names Felicisimo Lopez and Victor
<lb/>M, Pazmino, who at this time were living at 65 Ì Rutland Rd, Flatbush. They came
<lb/>by chance from the same tome in which ffl looked up my Dudley relatives, who lived
<lb/>oh Brooklyn Broadway near the end, at East NY, % father had often pointed out
<lb/>the hpuse on our way to the Evergreens and what was surprise at finding the
<lb/>Lopezand Pazminolifamilies listed on the same microficheJ That's how one gets
<lb/>information. The one good thing Nixon did was getting those records on film.
<lb/>The death certificates either wree s^twith the booklet from the funeral home
<lb/>or I gotthem from the NYChealth deptn\ I remember hearing that Stella had also
<lb/>attended something called Adelphi AcaaeDQr, but I don' know when, Iknow my
<lb/>Mother and the youngerkidsattended Erasmus, but Stella,..I didn't know,
<lb/>I remember when Stella went to Ayer Victor said to me "I don't know about
<lb/>Stella',' I remember how thin Stella was at Ken's wedding reception, in a
<lb/>blue dressshe had probably made herself, and how thin she also was the last
<lb/>year or so of her life, but Inever suspected. She had a special way of walking
<lb/>and I asked her about it once, Stella told me thatshe had learned, at Adelphi
<lb/>I guess, to walk and come down not on her heels but her toes. She was surprised
<lb/>I had noticed, I've always been snoopy, I guess. Always remember, too, Tfekes
<lb/>me dangerous. I'll stop her and go on tomorrow.
<lb/>Tomorrow,
<lb/>Lerame tell'ya about that'^PazMnc^ stone, since im i will no longer
<lb/>capitalize) icluding something about thi^lpazmino^stone, I designed it, after
<lb/>The ptonefor the bethany section, wherein grandfather, mother, uncle
<lb/>alfred, george or albert had found a stonemason near some cemetery in
<lb/>bay ridgej i guess it was george, through some of annBs Oopsi relatives,
<lb/>but the models they had had jesus or the holy whatsis or rosary beads
<lb/>or something Iknew nana would have hated, so i told the masoa red granite,
<lb/>thinking of the bethany stone, he said fine; i said no geegaws,..he said
<lb/>fine..,i said theres an"enye",,he said fine, and so the stone was selled
<lb/>thats settlled on, reddish granite a la bethany stone, etc, ashes will
<lb/>repose there after the time comesj after all, i belong there, george has
<lb/>the details. on the lopz stone.,,sometime in the 60s george noticed that
<lb/>the lopez stone, whihc had been awry for years, had toppled over because the
<lb/>ground in that older portion of the cemejsery had shifted with time and had
<lb/>taken the foundations aswell, wee george has the deeds, and they all state
<lb/>perpetual care, so he went to the evergreens office and said hey, my grand-
<lb/>]Par0nts! stone fell over and it says p, care, they said fine, sir, and the
<lb/>next time he visited the gravesites, they had fixed it/ that's service!
<lb/>i think nana's stone has a concrete feand running alongside to avoid the need
<lb/>for fpundation stones, i don't know about bethany, it was part of life to
<lb/>visit gravesites then, on menprial day or somethign. nai\radays youSre lucky if
<lb/>they notice, it was always a day out when wewere kids, stella and others used
<lb/>to tell us kids to keep quiet or something ilke that, we always treated it as
<lb/>something non-special, because as kids we didnt know the decesaedji or didnt .
<lb/>remember, i remember once going by trolley cai^Cnosjrrand then putnam) to get ^
<lb/>to the stones on some weekday when everone was working, a tremendous journey, /AV* Ì 9
<lb/>it was just one of the things one did, i dont think people think thusly nowada;^, 'Vjf
<lb/>they may be right, too, who will go to evergreens in 10 yrs ? by the by, lola
<lb/>who was nanas constant friend as well as sister, is buried in some catholic
<pb n="128" facs="#page-127"/>
<lb/>cemetery because the evergreens is non-sectarian, acin eloisa is buried in
<lb/>quite, strange thatthree sisters who were so close for over 50 yrs should
<lb/>be so far awaw in death,
<lb/>minday night,,,oh no, just when you thnk hes run out of steam he takes another
<lb/>breath I anyway, where was i? oh yes. the cemetery. Met or remembered his
<lb/>grandfather s funeral procession, from bklyn hts to evergreens, by coach, there
<lb/>were few cars then, even when we were kids, than there are now, and public
<lb/>transportation, at least in the cities, was better, mre frequent, nobody but
<lb/>harry had cars until the 50s, when they got the h9 dodge 2-door that george and
<lb/>i were in anaccident on farragut and bedford,,,another story,
<lb/>mamita.,.in the book "garcia moreno" bt luis robalino davila, guayaquil,
<lb/>no, quito, 19if8, the story, which i already knew, appears, mamita and her
<lb/>siblings were the children of a priest brother af garcia moreno named ma manuel
<lb/>ignacio G,M. so the death certificate has her parents' names reversed, nana s
<lb/>grandmother who did in the 188? fire in fe jipijapa as rosario roraero, raamitas
<lb/>mother, she was dark, but a different dark from the halfbreeds of the area, so
<lb/>where she came from and whajj sje was are a mystery, she wasa searvant in the
<lb/>garcia household in guayaquil and had 5 kids by this guy, this priest (as had
<lb/>or was the case with felicisimo), so the ancestay of the garcias, who come
<lb/>from villavea?de del monte, soria, spain, is in the a?obalino bk, i knew the
<lb/>stoay from nana, who told me almost all the storiesj all i ve done is recall,
<lb/>what she didnt tell me, eloisa did, or malvina, not too much from lola,
<lb/>anyway, mamita stoaries, she was the 1st, maybe only, person embalmed and laid
<lb/>out in the l/r on glenwood rd, nana told me she found somb Hoody rags that had
<lb/>fallen behing the tub||, wher mamita was embalmed, by the time papa died U yrs
<lb/>later, they used fairchida the funeral director, i tnik harry s mother was
<lb/>buried, or encaypted, from BÂ±la there, ill tell you a mamita stayo i bet yr
<lb/>mother doesnt know,one dau when lina was an infant (ineed since mamita died
<lb/>in October linad was always an infant) stella ba^ought linda over to glenwood
<lb/>to see mamita, or maybe it was on e 19th, i dont know, anyway linad put up
<lb/>a big cayfest and wouldnt let mamita hold her, stella was porbably moarbified
<lb/>as this was her grandmother, etc, but mamita, to put stella at her easij^ said
<lb/>that the baby was frightened because mamita was so old looking, knowing stella,
<lb/>she was probably not pleased at linda, ken remembers mamita as a shadowy
<lb/>figure, but joan remembers her well, neither linda nor i remeinber her. she was
<lb/>reputed, no, called by some friend in guayaquil, to be better lookling than
<lb/>any of her dtrs, joan remembers a beautiful little old lady with white hair,
<lb/>she iooked like her uncle gabriel gm, and had the garcia longevity, one day at
<lb/>90 she yold nana and eloisa that they should tell the (a) priest to come
<lb/>over and hear her last confession because she was going to die, nana and
<lb/>eloisa said nonsense, youre as fit as a fiddle, etc, the next day a priest came
<lb/>over, heard her confession, and the next day mamita quietly died at 90. she
<lb/>knwe, she was very mischeivous, intelligent and lively, all five of her sons
<lb/>predeceased her, not an easy thign for a mother, she had these godtrs in guayaquil
<lb/>woh were kids when mamita left in iSt 1901, but were grown up and stU wrote
<lb/>letters complaining abuot money, mamita always fell for it, but nana and eloisa
<lb/>were on to it and eloisa said no more money so you can send it to the alvears
<lb/>i thinlc their name was, so mamita, who crocheted and knit, went out a few
<lb/>times and rang the bells of the neighbours to sell her wares so she would
<lb/>get some money to send these goddjsrs, nana was mortified, but mamita did it
<lb/>ajiyway, she was independant,
<lb/>nana had no records because the night she arrived in this country,
<lb/>feb 111, 1900, she came with papa, 8 mth old victor, and her father Felicisimo
<lb/>as a fgn diplomat they just signed in or something and went off to a hotel,
<lb/>no ellis island, no nothing, 1^0 yrs later, when two of her sons were serving
<lb/>in WW II, she and papa were called to some govt office, nana felt sure that
<pb n="129" facs="#page-128"/>
<lb/>it was because some neighbour had overheard her ranting on about FDR because of
<lb/>his getting us into W II, but it was just that they had just passed the alien
<lb/>registration bill, which requred that each january all resident aliens in the
<lb/>cpuntry register, i remember a guy at my office an wall st looked at the card
<lb/>once and said it (Nanas birthdate) was like a westernj she was 83. she hated
<lb/>FDR because of the war but she had likedhim the first 8 yrs because of the
<lb/>depression, other times, nana remained an ecuadorean citizen til she died,
<lb/>she was proud of that,
<lb/>the photo on the postcard, in nanas hand, translates; "to our dear aunt
<lb/>lola, an affectionate greetng from brightoh beach from your nephews/nieces
<lb/>victor, estela adn alfred, august 29, 193)8" and on the other side;" although
<lb/>funny looking, im sending you a picture i had taken today at brighton, as you
<lb/>can see stella worked herself Â±h up to a bathing suti "Uhum, this girl has no
<lb/>brains',' on the other h^nd miguel would say 'is she needed to, its okay'"L(elia)
<lb/>th^s shows not just the kids, but the recollection of funny lines; i dont
<lb/>know this one, but im sure it made lola laugh,
<lb/>how did i know that date (of nanas arrival)? nana told me, she recalled
<lb/>that the boatwent from guayaquil to panama city,one took a train over the
<lb/>isthmus, then one got another steamer on the atlantic side, this was before
<lb/>teddy roosevelt stol^ panama frm Colombia, to get a better deal on the canal,
<lb/>nana recalled that they went to the 5th ave hetol, a one grand hostelry at
<lb/>23rs st opposite t^e flatiipn bldg, the first night, and abuelijso and papa
<lb/>left her and the 8 mth old victor there and they went to thÂ» opera to hear
<lb/>carmen, she reraembeted the whoosh-whoosh of the womens long skirts in the
<lb/>hallway, the man from room service wasaspaniard, not an easy thing to be
<lb/>so soon after the 1898 war,
<lb/>1912 avenue h,,,must have been a four floor walkup, i remember the
<lb/>yellow brick bldg 4^ the cofcndr, but i think thst fronted pn ocean, that was
<lb/>a nice neighborhood, near brboklun college, i guess Steph's records were
<lb/>destroyed during xjw ii (in europe) but 5 generationa is li lot, its not
<lb/>just the ages and the dates, but the people, if one knew them, ken referred
<lb/>to them (the pazminos) to eliza as a bunch of characjiers, thats probably
<lb/>right, too, but what charactersJ just a name is interesting, but when theres
<lb/>a story connected, then you have something, there are so many stories; the
<lb/>people never "die" as long as someone remembers,
<lb/>i havent done any research lately since i know it all already, i was
<lb/>interested 5 yrs ago or so in the dudley side, hence the visitto the census
<lb/>bureau, because although both sides are irish born, the name dudley is
<lb/>english, but thats about it, and even that lost its charm,
<lb/>oh, we even have some ancestors who are black! in south americs its
<lb/>not like here, where one is I/8 sioux or I/I6 mohivan; almost eveyubody has
<lb/>some Indian but its so removed, and one is so mixed, that its not spoken of,
<lb/>you grt-grandfather, stellas fthr, has blue eyes and areddish moustache,
<lb/>and some ancestors were blonds, so anything is possible, what i can say is
<lb/>that were"shamefully" inbred, which might explain some of the craziness,
<lb/>of which im the chief practitioner!
<lb/>me regarsd to you and Steph, and i promise to answer if written to.
<lb/>love.

<lb/>Dear CStirisj
<lb/>Got your ndsslve yesterday and was glad to/read it and finally see where
<lb/>Stella was buried. Since your Mother told nÂ® once that she had only gotten
<lb/>one letter from you while you were in school, so Is houldn't hope for jrtuch,
<lb/>I was very honored. But all in all, I was very glad to hearfrOTi jwu, I think the
<lb/>last note was idien youiwere a kid. Sit back, for this is going to be a long
<lb/>one, thpfigh it is tyrÂ©d with one hand (the left)} since Iwrote your Mother
<lb/>about two nrthsago, I've had sosne health probl^iis, about whivh the following.
<lb/>ArouM the beginning of "arch I noticed "ttiat I was having trouble writign
<lb/>and speaking, so the dr atSFOTV/Ard 86, whivh deals excellenjjly with AIDS
<lb/>patients, diagnoded tOKoplamosis, for Ì diich he prescribed thxvre antibiptics,
<lb/>none of which did any good, so he put nie in the hoHtad. for observation
<lb/>and stuff idiich todk several days and they found a lesion on lly cÂ»arebelliufn
<lb/>(brain) which Vrssy thought was PH., progressive mLtiforol leucoenÂ®ic^h-
<lb/>^opathy, which is bad, and itawasn't} they then diagnoded vasculitis, idiich
<lb/>is a series of snail strokes, which nakes moro sense, but it nay not be.
<lb/>The long aralshort of it all is that they don't know what it is, tdiidi I "Uiiidc
<lb/>is good because it keeps drs humble. But the lack of use of ttie right hand
<lb/>(it would be the ri^t) and the speech difficulties are continuing and are
<lb/>a nuisance. Nomjsheless, the mind remains good (I) and I jusy go on, IJhile
<lb/>Iwas in the hospital they discovered begiraiing CH7 Cytoraegaloviusus), an
<lb/>AIDS conplaint which takes away the sight} it was only in one eye and every
<lb/>day thejr IV at hcaia withxiSiBBaBBnii Foscanrot and salina solutim idiich
<lb/>makes me pee a lot at night. At least Istill wake up first I I'm tired a lot
<lb/>but I keep going on| after all, there are pet^le worse off than I am and
<lb/>I've been healthy so far, soooo,,,,But erasu^ of me. Let tiÂ» get to ycaa:
<lb/>letter,
<lb/>Felicisimo Â» Ataielito ("gramps") Franeisca â  ^fendta
<lb/>Victor Manuel Pasinom " Papa Lelia Lopez " Nana
<lb/>Victor Estenio Pa^ino â  Victor Dolores Ijopez â¢ Lola
<lb/>I tend to use the names Nana di#^ so if these are known to you, Exmise.
<lb/>The Lelia Es"tela Pazmino referred to is of cuoroe Stella, She was boro
<lb/>at # 6 Agate Oaurt, a shortstreet off Atlantic Avenue near Kingston Ave
<lb/>wMch Nana and Pai^ livÂ«i in at the time, and which even in iry day was
<lb/>in a neighborhbod you entered at the risk of your life, Bue because they
<lb/>wree "freethinkers" she wasnT baptized until she was 3, and thereby hangs
<lb/>a tale, Nana, Victor, and I (most stridently) wre anticlerical and non-
<lb/>Catholic, but Lola and ^femita were not, so Nam must have put-up with a
<lb/>lot of crap, until she finally gabe in Ì en her cousin NicolasF, Lopez
<lb/>and his first wife, a Chilean named Adela Putd-cio, visited Brooklyn
<lb/>in 19Qli, By thÂ«i thej? lived elsewhere, probably on ''ti.dwood St, Lola was Stella's
<lb/>godmother And Nitblas her godfather. Nanaremembered Ihe priest saying
<lb/>"Horroro" at theage of the child, ;3ust being baptized. As far as i know,
<lb/>Stella was the only one baptized} no, tliere was Victor, the only one born
<lb/>in Ecuador, whose godfather wsa Eloy Alfaro, A rocord of that rite was gotten
<lb/>years later when Vcitor got his Naturalization papers.
<pb n="131" facs="#page-130"/>
<lb/>( I just changed the ribbon, so,,,) This, despite or perhaps because of IJana's
<lb/>Father an HIS Father arri the priestly background of the Garcia Moreno clan.
<lb/>But STella,,,Des5-ite having in-laws who wree practicing this or that, Nana
<lb/>was very anti-Catholic, not the individuals butthe institution. She satyed
<lb/>that way until she died at 8^, But all of this is from her and from her
<lb/>sisjrer ELoisa, AH I'm doing is remembering, as does ny cousin JcÂ»n, who
<lb/>wre with Nana late in her life. The pictures you see of them show them in
<lb/>old age,afetr a lifetime fef disenchantnÂ»nts, But "ttiey all(I only knew the
<lb/>3 sistersand their couisn l%lvina) had great senses of hxnwjr and were always
<lb/>laughing. Ken remembere Lola as altrays laughtog at stmiething. And they all
<lb/>especially Nana lad great laraories. We wree very lucky, though we didn't alv/ays
<lb/>know it d% the tii^. Your grandmother, Stella, in a letter to George while he
<lb/>was oversea, says"Jiat so long as Ck&gt;g nakes worian like our Motlar, there is
<lb/>hq&gt;0 for tla salvation of thr world'i TW Mother, Lu, more succinctly, writes
<lb/>"Scans gal, our Mother? IHese wree letters written abAut Paia's death. Your
<lb/>grandfather, Harry Flandreau Disosway, was always spoken of highly by Nana,
<lb/>and thereby lies a tale which I just heard frera Joan. Stella worked for
<lb/>a Mrs May who had a tearoom in Bedford Sttiyvesant(See the picture with Mrs,
<lb/>T^y's dog) which is where she nÂ»t Harry^ who used to go there with his
<lb/>parents. She was the cashier, 'tJhen Harry later on "called Nana was happy.
<lb/>Not so regarding someone else who worked there, A Chinese or soMthign, who
<lb/>took a shine to Stella, reciprocated. Nana didnTt approve and once failed
<lb/>to give Stella a le|rber from this guy becauseshe didn' like the idea of
<lb/>Stella taking tra with a Chinese, Ordinaarily, Nana said she wouldn't have
<lb/>ineterfered bÂ£fiWnder the circu-mstances,,," He went atray and Stella forgot
<lb/>about him, ^
<lb/>I remejiftier once, nnisthave been the summer of Ì  '53, ona trip to the
<lb/>gravesites, we werrt; to the abbey at cypress Hills, nearby, to see the crsrpts
<lb/>of Harry&amp;s parents, which is I suppose where hewent, I thirfcLinda was with
<lb/>Harry and Stella and Harry broke down and cried, Hehad had at least one stroke
<lb/>by this time and was I think thinking of his cwn danise, Jfena exchar^ed a look
<lb/>with Victor, Harry died in October, I tnink of that year. He was about 10
<lb/>yrs older thsn Stella, and an only child, I ren^nflaer once when I was about
<lb/>10 or 11 running into Harry on Gleraood Rd, and thinking that he looked weak
<lb/>and agedj I guess he had had the first of his strokes then, but as a kid
<lb/>one didn't notice, and no one spoke of it in front of me, I reiiÂ»mbered him
<lb/>from when I was a kid and he used to take us kids forrides in his 38 Dodge,
<lb/>and of course from the xmas dinners. He was nice. He once, whem Stella had
<lb/>iut down her foot about scmietBing, I don't know what, told Victor "Youknow,
<lb/>Stella can be difficult at times',' I remember that(Victor told me) because
<lb/>it was so unlike him, A Ms Harrison, a teacherat PS 152, remembered your
<lb/>great-grandfatherSs Disosway having a phaimjaQr, which I remember telling
<lb/>her about(|t7 cousins) and your uncle Ken, and I think your Mother too,
<lb/>has 9 photograph of liiis man and Nana's brother Sara taken on Martense St,
<lb/>While Itnink oh it.,,?fertense is Dutch and one of the names of the old
<lb/>Dutch families in Brooklyn, Pieterso is for Pieterszoon, a patroroanic,
<lb/>and Deventer is a town in Holland near Zwolle, which has Â£ famous organ, ^
<lb/>It is interesting what discoveries one makes. There was a billboard COT?&gt;ar^
<lb/>in 1f?C named Disosway and Stadi SBsdat Fletcher, I think, who must have
<lb/>been realted, but no oneever investigated it, I only knew of a cousin of
<lb/>Haery's named Katherine Disosway, who lived with ELsa Smithon Plaza St in
<lb/>Brooklyn. There was also an Axmt Lula scaBswhere down southf your Mother
<lb/>would rÂ®Â»Â®mber.

<lb/>Before I forget, pleasÂ© give fondest regards to your Father the next iiiwe -
<lb/>you see or speak with him, IhÂ© eaclc^ed pictutes of tl^m I yook, as I did
<lb/>those of Stella, which might be the last taken of her, S(aaeplacÂ« along

<lb/>grandfather s funeral procession, from bidyn hte to evergreens, by coach, there
<lb/>were few cars then, even when were kids, than there are now, and public
<lb/>transportation, at least in tte cities, was better, mre frequent, nobody but
<lb/>harry had cars until the 50s, i^n they got the h9 dodge 2-door that geor^ and
<lb/>i were in anaccident on farragut and bedford,,,another story.
<lb/>!iÂ®mita,Â».in the book "garcia moreiw" bt luis rcbalino davila, guayaqull,
<lb/>no, quito, IPW, the story, which i already knew, appears, mamita and her
<lb/>siblings were the thildren of a priest brother af garcia moreno named vsm manual
<lb/>ignacio G.'t. so the death cerfcifi&lt;ate has her parents' names reversed, nana s
<lb/>grantsMher tho did in the 188? fire in jipijaja as rosario TOmero, mamitas
<lb/>mother, she was dark, but a different dark l^om the halfbreeds of the area, so
<lb/>where she came and what sje was are a mystery, she wasa servant in the
<lb/>garcia household in guayaqull and had 5 kids by this guy, this priest (as had
<lb/>or was the case with felicisirao), so the ancestry of tte garcias, the crane
<lb/>frran vUlaverde del nÂ»nte, soria, spain, is in the arobalino bk, 1 loiew the
<lb/>story from nana, isdio told me almost all the storl^l all i ve dra^ is rscaUL,
<lb/>what she didnt tell me, eloisa did, or Ì Ivina, not too mu&lt;h frtm lola,
<lb/>atyway, mamita stories, she was the 1st, maybe only, person embalmed and laid
<lb/>out in the l/r on glenwood rd, nana told me she fourri sra^ Hoodr rags that had
<lb/>fallen behing the tebj|, wher mamita was embalmed, by the time papÂ® died it yrs
<lb/>later, they used fairchida thÂ® funeral director, i trdk harry s mother was
<lb/>buried, or encaypted, from sth there, ill tell you a mamita stryo i bet yr
<lb/>motlwr doesnt kiw.one dau when lina was an infant (ineed since mamita died
<lb/>in October linad was always an infant) stella brou^t linda over to glenwood
<lb/>to see mamita, or maybe it was m e IJ'th, i dont know, anyway llnad put tqi
<lb/>a big cryfest and wouldnt let iratmita hold her, stella was poibably mortifirai
<lb/>as this was her grandnrother, etc, but mamita, to put stella at hÂ«r east, said
<lb/>that the baby was flightened because mawtta was so old looking, knoidng stella,
<lb/>she was protebly not pleased at linda, ken remeBbers mamita as a shadowy
<lb/>figure, but joan rei^ibeare her well, mither linda nor i remenber her. she was
<lb/>reputed, no, called by sonÂ® friend in guayaquil, to be better lookling than
<lb/>any of her dtrs, joan remenbers a beautiful little old la&lt;^ with white Imir,
<lb/>she iooked like her umsle gabriel gm, and had the garcia longevity, oiÂ» day at
<lb/>90 she yold nana and eloisa that they should tell the (a) priest to crane
<lb/>over aid hear her last confession because she ms going to die, nÂ®na and
<lb/>eloisa said nomense, youre as fit as a fiddle, etc, the next day a priest raime
<lb/>over, heard her confession, and the mxt day mamita quietly died at 90. she
<lb/>knwe, ste was very ndscbeivous, intelligent and lively, all five of her sons
<lb/>predeceased her, not an easy thign for a mother, she had these godtrs in guayaqull
<lb/>woh were kids when SBmita left in 1901, but were grown up and stll wrote
<lb/>letters complaining abuot nwney, maraite always fell for it, but nana and eloisa
<lb/>were on to it and eloisa said ik&gt; more iJicaÂ®y so you can send it to the alvears
<lb/>i think their naiiÂ® was, so mamita, who cjwiheted and knit, wrarb out a few
<lb/>tiros aid rang thÂ© bolls of the neighbours to sell her wares so she would
<lb/>get some money to send these godd;^, mm was mortified, but mamita did it
<lb/>ajorway* she was iid^jendant,
<lb/>naiÂ® had no records because the night she arrived in this ecuntry,
<lb/>fob lit, 1900, she came with pÂ®pa, 8 mth old victor, aad her father Felicisirao
<lb/>as a fgn diplrarot they just sigrod in or sorothing and went off to a hotel,
<lb/>no Â©Ills island, no nothing, hO yrs later, when two of her sons were serving
<pb n="134" facs="#page-133"/>
<lb/>it was because sam r^ighbour had overtieard her ranting on about FIB because of
<lb/>his getting us into W II, but it was just that they had just passed the alien
<lb/>registration bill, which requred that each january all resident alibis in the
<lb/>cpuntry register, i i^raen4&gt;er a gay at vy office an wall st looked at the card
<lb/>once arÂ«J said it (Nanas birthdate) was like a westerai she was 83, she hated
<lb/>FDR because of the war but shÂ© had likedhiia the first 3 yrs because of -ttie
<lb/>depression, other tijnes, nana remained an ecuadorean citizen til she died,
<lb/>she was proud of that,
<lb/>photo on the postcard, in nanas hand, translates: "to our dear aunt
<lb/>lola, an affectiomte greetng from brighter beach from your nephews/nieces

<lb/>Dear Linda,
<lb/>Got your ^tter today and am hurrying to respond, dictating
<lb/>this to a friend and including Ì  pages I sent to Chris
<lb/>several weeks ago in response to a letter of his, so you*re
<lb/>the first to know.
<lb/>I'm a messl I have trouble speaking and will in about 3-^
<lb/>weeks^ enter a local hospice because I can no longer take
<lb/>care of myself as a resiilt of loss of balance and that's
<lb/>about itÂ» The doctors don't know what's causing all of
<lb/>thisj personally, I think it's an HIV things they say now
<lb/>"maybe Not," but they can do nothing about itÂ» So, while
<lb/>mind is alert, which of COURSE it is, damn it, liii taking
<lb/>steps now for the time that it isn't. And that's not a
<lb/>problem, except for the cats and the goodies. So I haven't
<lb/>told any body yet, for no reason except that I haven't
<lb/>written ariy letters. It is not a matter of looking sad or
<lb/>down on things, it's just life which I'm sur you will
<lb/>understand.
<lb/>Foster and 19th are like Glenvrood and East 21stj them days
<lb/>ARE gone forever and who knoT&gt;TS why. That's why it is fun
<lb/>to look back add i^member, which some people - myself included
<lb/>do too much of. Your mother was different from N ana, she waff
<lb/>like Papa- in that she, like Leslie, knew that poverty was not
<lb/>supposed to be the case for us. She was that way Â« not that
<lb/>it means money hungry. She always maintained, like EloisÂ®
<lb/>did and Nana did not,
<lb/>Chriff' interest in the past is strange but welcoiiÂ«, I
<lb/>think one leams a lot from viewing the past and he does it
<lb/>with all his ancestors, not just ours. Where would we be
<lb/>if we did not knot; WHY T something happened, which you can
<lb/>sometimes tell through ancestor worship. One can avoid a
<lb/>lot of problems if one knows what has gone before. And it's
<lb/>interesting,, especially if you know the people involved and
<lb/>some of their activities. His wife's having had grandparents
<lb/>wfeo lived on East 19th aid H, and his having had them on
<lb/>East 19th between F and G is a strange coincidence. The whole
<lb/>city â¢â and the same area. It's like Papa's consulate being
<lb/>in the same building that was later rented by Raymond. It's
<lb/>a big city, but it isn't.
<lb/>So that's what's new with me, I hope you are feeling better&gt;
<lb/>which you seem to be, I dnn't have any pain or discomfort
<lb/>which you must have experienced. But they never told us
<lb/>that old age was as troublesome. They just sighed, I too
<lb/>have grown more conservative in past years and I would not
<lb/>like to see B rooklyn again now. That was part of our past,
<lb/>I hope all goes well for youj I'll let you know what happens
<lb/>to me when I move, I have to find homes for the cats. Talk
<lb/>to you lateir -
<lb/>JOSEPH
