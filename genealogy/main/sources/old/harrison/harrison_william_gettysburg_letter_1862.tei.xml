<p>
<lb/>Dear Mother
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Once more
<lb/>I’ll endeaver to write a few
<lb/>lines to you.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>I’m well and getting along
<lb/>finely and I hope these few
<lb/>lines will find you enjoying
<lb/>the same blessings.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>I was some what disapointed
<lb/>last Eve in not receiving
<lb/>a letter from Hornby. But
<lb/>I suppose you’re all like my<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/><pc>=</pc>self have to wait till sunday
<lb/>before you cand find time to write.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Friday Eve I received a letter
<lb/>from Uncle Williams folks.
<lb/>They seem to remember me oc<pc>&#x2010;</pc>
<lb break="no"/><pc>=</pc>casionally. I’ve written to them once.
</p>
<pb n="2" facs="#page-001"/>
<p>
<lb/>I guess you would all
<lb/>laugh if you should see my
<lb/>writing desk. But you know that
<lb/>necesity is the mother of invention.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This morning is cold and windy
<lb/>and it reminds me of the
<lb/>cold and bleak Februray mornings
<lb/>that I’ve seen in old Hornby.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And when I think of one
<lb/>thing it reminds me of many
<lb/>others, of the kind and loving
<lb/>Mother kind Brothers, and tender
<lb/>Sisters, that I’ve left in my
<lb/>own childhood home, to go forth
<lb/>to fight the battles of my own
<lb/>loved Country. Of the many
<lb/>kind friend that I’ve spent
<lb/>my youthful days among. I cannot
<lb/>help of<del rend="overstrike">f</del> thinking off them nor neither
<lb/>do I wish too. And I hope
<lb/>that I shall so conduck myself
<lb/>that when I return it may be
<pb n="3" facs="#page-002"/>
<lb/>with a clear conscience that
<lb/>I’ve done my duty.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>How little did I think
<lb/>one short year ago that I should
<lb/>now be a soldier and undergoing
<lb/>the <subst><del>rigors of</del><add type="overwrite">privatation</add></subst> of camp life, how
<lb/>different is the situations of
<lb/>men. How cheqered is life.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>But amoung the so<subst><del>de</del><add type="overwrite">ldi</add></subst>ers
<lb/><choice><sic>ome</sic><corr>one</corr></choice> can find many friends
<lb/>who will stand by him until
<lb/>the last. There one finds all
<lb/>kinds o<subst><del>f</del><add type="overwrite">a</add></subst>nd classes. it is a
<lb/>place where m<subst><del>a</del><add type="overwrite">e</add></subst>n will show
<lb/>their dispositions, each one
<lb/>for himself is the most prevailing
<lb/>complaint. But there is a light
<lb/>as well as a dark side. there
<lb/>are many pleasures, and if one
<lb/>makes up his mind to take
<lb/>things easy and make the best
<lb/>of it he will get along well enough
</p>

<p>
<lb/>We have moved into our barracks
<lb/>and have been paid off up till
<lb/>the first of January and the
<lb/>first of next month we are
<lb/>to be paid again. I guess I’ll
<lb/>wait until next pay day before
<lb/>I send any mony home. It
<lb/>cost so much to send by Express
<lb/>and the time is so short is why I
<lb/>wait. We only get $ 13.00 per
<lb/>month. I rec<hi rend="sup">d...</hi> $ 27.30 we got
<lb/>pay from time of enlistment.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>There was a considerable dissatisfaction
<lb/>in regard to pay as they all enlisted
<lb/>with the expectations of getting $ 14.00
<lb/>per month. There was some talk
<lb/>of our being sent in Gen. Lanes
<lb/>Expedition to Texas Arizonia and
<lb/>New Mexico. I wish <subst><del><unclear>they</unclear></del><add>they</add></subst> would send
<lb/>us as I want to go. Good Bye
</p>
<ab>
<lb/>This from your Unworthy Sone William N. Harrison
