<lb/>In Hornby, May 30!;h,lSS)r,Hannafi, wife
<lb/>of Henry Harrison, aged 45 years.
<lb/>One calm Sabbath morning, the portals
<lb/>of Heaven
<lb/>Were opened, and softly an angel pass
<lb/>ed through—
<lb/>A messenger chosen by God in His wis-
<lb/>dora,
<lb/>Who hastened an errand of mercy to
<lb/>do. ')
<lb/>We sat by the side of our suffering loved
<lb/>one.
<lb/>And waited, and watched for the angel
<lb/>to come!'
<lb/>And the lips that we loved had often re
<lb/>peated,
<lb/>"Inm so weary, I long to go home."
<lb/>Yes; she was so weary, so weary of suifer-
<lb/>"  lug.
<lb/>Her pain-tortured body was longing for
<lb/>rest.
<lb/>The pitying angel bent over and kissed
<lb/>her,
<lb/>And lo! she was sleeping the sleep of
<lb/>the blest I ^
<lb/>She peacefully sleeps;.her pain all for
<lb/>gotten;
<lb/>And none can awaken her now save the
<lb/>Lord. •
<lb/>She was ready and waiting, her work all
<lb/>completed—
<lb/>She has gone on before' to receive her
<lb/>reward.
<lb/>—A Feiend.
