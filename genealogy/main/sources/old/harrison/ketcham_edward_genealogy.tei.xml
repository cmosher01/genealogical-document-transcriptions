<lb/>Synopsis of Edward Ketcham's Life
<lb/>The following is a brief synopsis of what is known about Edward Ketcham (b. 1590s, England,
<lb/>d. 8 June 1655, Stratford, Conn.), the probable progenitor of all Ketchams in America.

<lb/>Edward Ketcham in England.
<lb/>Edward Ketcham is first found in Cambridge, England from 1619 to 1628, where his marriage
<lb/>to Mary Hall on 22 Aug 1619 is recorded in the records of the Church of Saint Andrew the
<lb/>Great, as well as the birth of his children Mary (bapt. 7 May 1620), John (bapt. 8 Sep 1622),
<lb/>Hester (bapt. 10 Apr 1626), and Ann (bapt. 19 Oct 1628). No other records of Edward or other
<lb/>Ketchams are found in Cambridge.
<lb/>Back to Tod | Home
<lb/>Immigration to America.
<lb/>Edward Ketcham is next found in Ipswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635. He may
<lb/>have arrived in 1630 on the Winthrop fleet or in 1633 on the Ipswich. By 1637 Edward was
<lb/>reportedly on the Board of Freemen, the town council of Ipswich.
<lb/>Back to Tod | Home
<lb/>Edward Ketcham's homestead in Ipswich.
<lb/>Ginger Stork reports that an early deed shows that Samuel Boreman purchased property from
<lb/>Edward Ketcham in 1640, and that Boreman sold to Francis Jordan.! jf go^ Edward Ketcham's
<lb/>home in Ipswich is no longer standing.^ Jordan's lot is located on the corner of East Street and

<lb/>Brook Street.3 The house currently standing on the lot, however, is much later than the I640s.^

<lb/>His moves.
<lb/>Sometime after January 1640 Edward moved from Ipswich to Hashamommock, later Southold,
<lb/>Long Island, where in 1651 the first record of him is found. Sometime later Edward moved to
<lb/>Stratford, Connecticut.
<lb/>Back to Tod | Home
<lb/>Edward Ketcham's will.
<lb/>Edward's will was made 8 June 1655 at Stratford, Fairfield Co., Connecticut. While damaged in
<lb/>places and missing sections which apparently contained the names of some of his children, it
<lb/>does list the following children: John, Mary, Hannah (an alternate spelling of "Anna"), and
<lb/>Hester. These four children are the same as those of the Edward Ketcham of Cambridge,
<lb/>England. Edward's estate was valued at 90 pounds, 11 shillings, 6 pence.
<lb/>Back to Top | Home
<lb/>His children.
<lb/>James E. Morton, who wrote a genealogy column for the Boston Transcript under the penname
<lb/>Amiko, noted that there are almost as many versions of the family of Edward Ketcham as
<lb/>writers on the subject.^ Edward's four children whose baptismal records have been found in
<lb/>Cambridge, England (Mary, John, Hester, and Ann/Hannah) are certain. All four children
<lb/>were most likely with Edward's first wife, Mary Hall. The evidence indicates that Edward
<lb/>married a Sarah Salman of Southold, Long Island. The differences arise over as many as five
<lb/>purported children, Edward, Samuel, Sarah, Rebecca, and Joseph. Interestingly, Edward's will,
<lb/>deteriorated with significant lacunae, contains only the names Mary, John, Hester, and
<lb/>Ann/Hannah. The names of the other children, most Ketcham genealogists assume, were to be
<lb/>found in the lacunae. The writers do not address the probability that Edward's will
<lb/>deteriorated in such a way that only the names of the children that are known from other
<lb/>sources remained. At this point, I believe Herbert Eurman Seversmith is correct that Edward
<lb/>had no sons Edward or Samuel.^ The events attributed to Edward's purported sons Edward
<lb/>and Samuel are better attributed to Edward's grandsons of the same names, sones of Edward's
<lb/>son John. Thus, Edward's children were, at most:
<lb/>Mary (b. 1620)
<lb/>John (b. 1622)
<lb/>Hester (b. 1626)
<lb/>Ann (Hannah) (b. 1628)
<lb/>Sarah (b. abt. 1639)
<lb/>Rebecca (b. c. 1645)
<lb/>Joseph (b. 1650)
<lb/>A preliminary genealogical report of eight generations of Edward Ketcham's descendants, not
<lb/>yet reflecting this conclusion, is available.

<lb/>Edward Ketcham's ancestry.
<lb/>Edward Ketcham's ancestry has not been established. Among the possibilities, two of the more
<lb/>likely are reported in Ginger Stork's The Known Descendants of Edward
<lb/>Ketcham/Catchum/Cetcham - Puritan (Davison, MI: O.K. Stork, 1995), v.
<lb/>(1) James Chetham of Cromsall, County Lancashire, England. The
<lb/>Visitation ofSujfolke (England), by William Hervey, contains the pedigree of a
<lb/>James Chetham (the spelling "Cheetham/Chetham" was used for Edward in
<lb/>Cambridge in the 1620s). In 1635 James Chetham, then about 69 years old,
<lb/>recalled his personal pedigree. His children: Edward, George, Henrie, Edmund,
<lb/>James, Humfrey, Edmund, Jane, and Isabell. Significantly, a Henry Ketcham
<lb/>appears in Ipswich in 1635, in addition to Edward (see below).
<lb/>(2) Sir Robert Kytchen, Mayor of Bristol. An unsigned manuscipt reportedly
<lb/>located in the New York City Library states: "Edward Ketcham was the son or
<lb/>grandson of Sir Robert, Alderman of Bristol, England who died 19 June 1594", and,
<lb/>a few pages later, "Edward son of Abel and grandson of Sir Robert, Mayor of
<lb/>Bristol. In the days of Sir Robert and his father the name was given as Kytchen."
<lb/>The Gloucester Archaeology Society has stated that the name "Ketcham" was given
<lb/>in later periods as "Kitchin" or "Kytchin." Richard Kitchin and son Robert were
<lb/>residents of Temple, Bristol County, England, in 1585, and Robert's effigy lies in St
<lb/>Stephen Church in Temple.
<lb/>Obviously, James Chetham's children fit with the "mysterious" Henry Ketcham found in
<lb/>Ipswich. Without any further information, the unsigned manuscript in the New York City
<lb/>Library appears much less probable. That it was even included as a possibility is a result of the
<lb/>tendency to claim noble or royal background, if only a city mayor here. As Seversmith wryly
<lb/>noted regarding the purported ancestor "Sir Rowland Ketcham, Knight of Wales," Auf Caesar,
<lb/>autnihill.
<lb/>In sum, Edward Ketcham's ancestry remains unproven, but further work should be done in
<lb/>investigating James Chetham of Cromsall, County Lancashire, England.
<lb/>Back to Tod | Home
<lb/>Edward Ketcham: The Progenitor of all Ketchams? (Herein also
<lb/>of Henry Ketcham.)
<lb/>It is probable that Edward Ketcham is the progenitor of all Ketchams in America. While likely,
<lb/>it is only probable because two caveats have been noted: the mysterious Henry Ketcham and
<lb/>the "Scottish Ketchams."
<lb/>A Henry Ketcham is found in Ipswich, Massachusetts, in 1638. (Savage 1990. vol. 3, p. 14.)
<lb/>According to the published genealogies, we know nothing further of Henry Ketcham or his
<lb/>descendants (are there any out there?). While the presence of Henry Ketcham is troubling for a
<lb/>definitive answer to the question, Henry Ketcham is almost certainly related to Edward
<lb/>Ketcham. If Henry is not Edward's son, they are likely brothers (it is highly unlikely that two
<lb/>unrelated Ketchams would be found in Ipswich together in 1635). If that is the case, the
<lb/>progenitor of all Ketchams (assuming Henry's descendants are in fact among us), is Edward's
<lb/>07/16/1999 3:18 PM
<pb n="4" facs="#page-003"/><lb/>Edward Ketcham http://fp-www.wwnet.net/"'jketcham/edward.htm
<lb/>and Henry's father ~ an as yet unnamed "Ketcham" who is the progenitor of us all!
<lb/>Some of the Ketcham genealogies also allege the existence of Scottish "Ketchams," a Scottish
<lb/>clan whose name (in Gaelic) is spelled differently than "Ketcham" but which sounds similar.
<lb/>None of the books give any further information, or the source of this story.
<lb/>Without further evidence that Henry Ketcham left descendants and is not Edward's son, we
<lb/>may conclude that Edward Ketcham is in fact the father of us all. If not Edward, the progenitor
<lb/>of all Ketchams is Edward's father. We are all related!

<lb/>Bibliography and further reading.
<lb/>The single best (and only?) published work on Edward Ketcham, other than those in the family
<lb/>genealogies, is John Insley Coddington's "Edward Ketcham of Cambridge, Co. Cambridge, and
<lb/>Elsewhere in England, Later of Ipswich, Mass., Southold, L.I., and Stratford, Conn.," The
<lb/>American Genealogist 30, no. 1 (January 1954), 2-6. Of the family genealogies, the most
<lb/>complete is Ginger (Ketchum) Stork's The Known Descendants of Edward
<lb/>Ketcham/Catchum/Cetcham - Puritan (Davison, Mich.: C. K. Stork, 1995). Similar material
<lb/>can be found in the earlier Ketcham Kables.
<lb/>Edward Ketcham is mentioned in James Savage's^ Genealogical Dictionary of The First
<lb/>Settlers of New England (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 1965-1990).
<lb/>In June 1637, 56 men of Ipswich signed a petition requesting that the younger John Winthrop
<lb/>be allowed to remain in Ipswich instead of being sent to govern Castle Island in Boston harbor.
<lb/>Edward Ketcham signed the petition (spelling his name as "Katcham"). A photograph of the
<lb/>petition and Edward Ketcham's signature may be found in Thomas F. Waters, Ipswich in the
<lb/>Massachusetts Bay Colony (Ipswich, Mass.: Ipswich Historical Society, 1901). Edward's
<lb/>signature is on the second page of the petition (be prepared to hunt!).
<lb/>The primary source for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop's journal, has recently
<lb/>been reprinted in an excellent edition by Richard S. Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle, The Journal of
<lb/>John Winthrop, 1630-1649 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1996), an
<lb/>unabridged, old-spelling edition. An abridged, modern-spelling edition in paperback
<lb/>containing 40% of the text of the unabridged edition is also available: Richard S. Dunn and
<lb/>Laetitia Yeandle, The Journal ofJohn Winthrop, 1630-1649, abr. ed. (Cambridge, Mass.:
<lb/>Harvard University Press, 1996).
<lb/>Edward Ketcham was a Puritan. Among the many excellent resources available on the Puritans,
<lb/>one work will put you in touch with how Edward Ketcham lived, David Hackett Fischer's
<lb/>Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989), pp.
<lb/>13-205. Superb history! An excellent web-site on a well-known group of Puritans, the
<lb/>Pilgrims: Mavflower Web Pages.
<lb/>For a fascinating history of the ships on which Edward may have travelled, the Winthrop fleet,
<lb/>see Charles Edward Banks, The Winthrop Fleet of1630, An Account of the Vessels, the Voyage,
<lb/>the Passengers and their English Homes from the Original Authorities (Boston: The Riverside
<lb/>Press, 1930).

<lb/>Society's page on the John Whipple House.
