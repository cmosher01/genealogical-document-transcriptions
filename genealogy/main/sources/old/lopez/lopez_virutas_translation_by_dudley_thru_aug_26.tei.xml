<pb n="2" facs="#page-001"/><lb/>TO THE HEMER
<lb/>Seated at iTij/ desk on the inorning of January 190&lt;^ having in front of me
<lb/>a cale-ndar/ineinorandiiraji a gift of ^ son of rainej, there cane to ny nenory that vhich
<lb/>Victor Hugo states in one of his luninous irritingSj that ts that he--as in the habit
<lb/>of carrying a pencil in his fiocketj in order to ini'nedlatel;^ record any thought that
<lb/>cccurred tc liipi as he nalkedi these thoughts he called :iis Shavings. Though I in no
<lb/>ray reserble Victor Higo. that geiiius of tlie IS^th cont-ury^ 1 thought that I too
<lb/>should collect day by da;' in this rneniorandura ny ovn thoughts^ and I decided to
<lb/>CO Just that starting that very day.
<lb/>Here then.;, discreet reader, those shavings i/hich I liave been abile to plane
<lb/>froin the roug};i -nood of I'iy :nind during one yeai'^ and not witli very fine to2Q.sj
<lb/>nevertheless^ here they are^ collected, offered to you as a poor sample of the
<lb/>effoi'bs of a uorker who, though irithout doubt ine:cpert, had good intentions.
<lb/>Do not disesteem them, but keep in mind that often poor and hiurble people
<lb/>cock their food urith shavings that they have been able to collect vhere they were
<lb/>discarded. &gt;jay Fate grant tb.at you will also be able to gS,in from them, if not a
<lb/>good fire to cook your intell,ectual nourishment, then a soft warmth to help ripen
<lb/>the fruit of your own thoughts.
<lb/>JAHIIART
<lb/>One of the proofs of the Law of Progress is the Joy with which everybody
<lb/>greets the new year, for Hope is the angel of mercy who points to the future,
<lb/>which is always better, even for the;npst unfortunate. C}i, writhout hope human life
<lb/>wjould be torture, for to hope i,s to leave the eeqeectation of change, wdiatever the
<lb/>condition of the one wrho hopes. The first day of tlee year has a suggestive influence
<lb/>on all people, for they believe tliey sss believe they see the beginning of som.e
<lb/>change which will satisfy their wishesj tlierefore, it is children and the poor who
<lb/>most celebrate the first moment of each year. Very unhappy must be the person who
<lb/>has not hoped to hear, surrounded by smiles and kisses, the clock strike 12 on
<lb/>the 31st 01 December.
<lb/>One of the reasons that liabits are perpetuated is, without doubt, that
<lb/>hiu.ian nature is easily domiiiated bu the magnetic attractiori, of people and objects
<lb/>of daily touch and contact. It requires a vigorous effort of wTil?Lpower to conquer
<lb/>that force of attraction and aim it in another direction and towards other goals,,
<lb/>luhence it follows that in order to improve habits, it is necessary to direct human
<lb/>will towards nobler and more elevated ends, a result that can only be obtained by
<lb/>improving the system of eduaction for the people, ibuld you make people free, and
<lb/>therefore happy? Then educate them for the practical life within the orbit of duty.
<pb n="3" facs="#page-002"/><lb/>Revolution^ Xirhich is a social illnessj is nonetheless saving the Latin
<lb/>American republics froin the claws of absolute goverriments which traffic in a
<lb/>politics. The wires today have brought the news of a saving revolution^ and
<lb/>I say saviing because it has been demanded by the general opinion of that
<lb/>country. Ti.\ro successive governments have cinically abused the confidence
<lb/>shown then by the people^ who have seen no other choice but to have recourse
<lb/>to arms in order to bring to the public scene new and honest men. I an certain
<lb/>that this revolution will succeed.
<lb/>( Tiito wee'us after this viruta ifas set dowu^ the news arra.ved in New York by
<lb/>wii'e of the complete triuiiiph of this revolutiop^, the quickest and least costly
<lb/>recorded in the Iiistory of that country.)
<lb/>God is the supreme Harmony; therefore melodious music elevates and moves
<lb/>the soul which is capable of being inroressed by those sublime vibrations, kith
<lb/>good cause is it said that music is the divine art. hfusic operates a healthj^
<lb/>transformation in humanity, for harmonious vibrations cause the fluids of the
<lb/>spirit to harrnmnize, and thereby/ cure the physical and mental disturbances of man.
<lb/>hiedical science is making use of sentimiental music as a preferred treatment for
<lb/>illnesses of the nerves. "
<lb/>Melody is one of the best means to soften the rougimesses of the soul dna
<lb/>sweeten the character; for that reason- music is a powerful resource of civiliza
<lb/>tion, Perhaps a good music conservatory is more fruitful to society than a
<lb/>university. The former educates the senses, the latter, the intelligence.
<lb/>Educated sentiment brings with it morality'", for it elevates the affections of the
<lb/>heart: educated intelligence produces the enlightenment wliich brightens the in
<lb/>tellect with scientific knowledge. These teo types of eduaction, harmonised and
<lb/>working together, make people civilized. For that reason the great enlightened
<lb/>moralists Ì re giving preference to elevated music in religious practices.
<lb/>Mithout the cooperation of invisible intelligences, hiunai progress ujould be
<lb/>less tlian impossible. The musician, the poet, the scientist, and the inventor are
<lb/>the preferred recipients of that hidden and usually unconscious cooperation,
<lb/>which in human language has been called inspirabion. It is now a scientific doctriine
<lb/>that earthly huraanity lives and m.oves in the midst of another invisible h'Onanity,
<lb/>whose influence is efficient and decisive. In all times men have believed in
<lb/>communication with invisible beings, and history is filled with admirable cases
<lb/>in wluLch tliat coimnunication has become patently clear, but never as much as now
<lb/>have men been in intimate contact with that world of the invisible.
<lb/>Just as a man cannot live healthy and robust life if he does not eat and
<lb/>exercise every day, neither can he fortify his kitelligence if he doesn't evercise
<lb/>it with thought and nourlsii it with good reading. From there it follows that the
<lb/>people who read the most are ttie most a dvanced, and if they read more it is
<lb/>because tkey have multi-plied their schools and lymroved their methods of teaching.
<pb n="4" facs="#page-003"/>
<lb/>In earlier times it was believed that kno&gt;n.ng how to read and write was a vulgar
<lb/>ttdng and the province of lowborn people^ and therefore it was enough for the
<lb/>gehtlemai of the aristocracyto know hov* to grasp his smrd for the jousts of love,
<lb/>and the girl of good lineage needed only to know how to pray to hold herself as
<lb/>educated. Given such ideas, it is no surprise that ignorance and superstition
<lb/>flourished in the upper classes. Tlie best people have di\"ays come from the poorer
<lb/>and humblerclasses.
<lb/>Hiere are active and passive intelligencesj the former are creative, and in
<lb/>ascending scale tlTej?- can reach genius level; the latter are nourished bj^ the creations
<lb/>of the former, and malce up the great class of propagandists. The forraer are the
<lb/>teachers, the Hatter the students-: the former are the redeemers, the latter the
<lb/>apostles, but they are all equi.lly benefactors of humanity, for they are raising
<lb/>it from the abyss of ignorance and imperfection towards the Eden of science and
<lb/>virtue.
<lb/>He w-ho sows the seed of evil will sooner or later Iriave tp taste its bitter
<lb/>fruit, which flowers, develops and matures in his own conscience. The malefactors
<lb/>of mankind are worthy of pity, for through their oum will they are working their
<lb/>own ruin. The iniquitous person who in his blindness believes himself all-powerful
<lb/>to vrreak evil upon others fails to see that he is putting the noose around his ca-m
<lb/>neck: he belongs to the group that Campoamor calls " are hanged in their own breasts',"
<lb/>rfusic, like religion,, is a revelation of God, and therefore progressive.
<lb/>Not all people are capable of Ì predating the melodiuos music which elevistaes
<lb/>the feelings of the spirit. The conmion people are satisfied with noisy music,
<lb/>as in the showy and childish ceremonies of religions: onl;/ in proportion to its
<lb/>instructing itself and educating its taste can it seek and ^preciate the charms
<lb/>of sentimental aid div5-ne music. Ero.m thj-S it follows that those who have been
<lb/>named to direct the destinies of the people have the obligation of cultivating
<lb/>that kind of music that cleanses and purifies the soul.
<lb/>Experience is the great school in idiich mai can achieve his physical, intellectual
<lb/>and moral progress. Therefore it is generally said that experience equals Icnowledgeo
<lb/>In tlie daily book of life, man rndEs notes of great importance for his own advancement,
<lb/>be they that pain and suffering should form the basis of his l.ife, or that joys and
<lb/>pleasures should be the high points in the program of his eartlily existence o It is
<lb/>certain tliat the longer a human lives, the more interesting will be tliat book in
<lb/>which his own experiences iiave been noted down. Tlie oldest souls han/e advanced the
<lb/>mo^t in their progress.
<lb/>In the realrii of the jaaterial, there is hut one step from pleasure to paiUo
<lb/>Go to exrTÂ»emes in the pleasures pf the tahle and indigestion or gout will make you
<lb/>feel this trutli, and tlie same thi.ng is true for aO. t:}e other organic functions
<pb n="5" facs="#page-004"/>
<lb/>which give pleasiwe to maiij such as the sexiial function. The exhaustion of
<lb/>strength, the loss of sp petite add physical pains are unfailing consequences
<lb/>of abuse. From there the great tru.th expressed in the old Spanish saying:
<lb/>"IJhence you sin you will pay'.' That is another valuable lesson of experience,
<lb/>only useful for those who have left behind the unreflecting time of youth.
<lb/>Personal interest gone astray, that is, egotism, is a].ways at war with the
<lb/>common good and an obstacle to progress. Hence egotists are no good
<lb/>as public servants, because they do everything for their own personal gain,
<lb/>which ruins and corrupts everything if it is not counterbalanced by a healthy
<lb/>moral sense. The egotist is infertile for other people, for as he has concentrated
<lb/>his thoughts on himself, that magnetic current has killed in his soul the seed
<lb/>of the coriirnon good.
<lb/>The best signs for recognizing the progress of the spirit are disinterest
<lb/>edness and abnegation, virtues opposed to egotism and greed. To acquire the former,
<lb/>many reincarnations are needed, in which the human spirit slowly cleanses itself
<lb/>of the stains acquired previously. Egotism which is ill-directed and has strayed
<lb/>becomes a degrading passion, because it keeps man stuck to the material and
<lb/>perishable things in life. Greed is the exaggeration of egotism, and consequently
<lb/>the most disastrous thing for the moral progress of m.ankind.
<lb/>Religious fanaticism is notliing more than an epidemic obsession, transiTiitted
<lb/>by teaching, perpetuated by habit and sustained by clerical interest, ""fental
<lb/>suggestion exercises a powerful influence on fanatical roasses, and is capable of
<lb/>propelling them towards the most ridiculous acts, or the most shocking and bloody
<lb/>scenes,; therefore religious wars have been cruel and barbaric, as the fruits of
<lb/>an unconscious mental imbalance. The onlj'' vaccine against those epidemics is
<lb/>education, but w^hen these epidemics are fully developed and in all their fury,
<lb/>the most effective cure is ffiSfeEia vigorous legislation.
<lb/>With time medicine mil vanish and only hygiene mil remain, for mankind will
<lb/>becomie convinced that it is easier to prevent illness than cure it. Illness is
<lb/>nothing more t]:.an the tra;isgression of a natural law tlirough ignorance or care
<lb/>lessness, and the way to avoid these transgressions is to educate people to know
<lb/>and respect natuiraj- laws, whiich civilization has violated Â±j03.3hiimiiteiiiEiiBeEDatDCE
<lb/>by disparaging habits and custoiTis. The peoples and individuals who through convic
<lb/>tion have returned, to the abaadoned path of Nature no longer need doctors or
<lb/>pharmaciesj t?iey have enough in the enlightened streng'bh of tlieir own willpower
<lb/>to keep their lives free of the aches and pans acquired in the pursuit of
<lb/>illusoiy pleasures.
<pb n="6" facs="#page-005"/>
<lb/>Progress is adiieved at tb.e cost of the past, for the sane spirt is who mth
<lb/>their errors bogged people down return to existence to take charge of correcting
<lb/>those errors and causing people to advance. Thus is explained the g^pearance of
<lb/>beings, seemingly privileged, who have brought the mission of doing good for
<lb/>humanity at the cost of their own sacrifice. Thus also is explained the law of
<lb/>human solidarity, that is, that fellowship of interests among all human beings,
<lb/>which the Romans perpetuated throughout history with their very famous maxim:
<lb/>"I am hmnan, and nothing human do I judge dien to m.e'.'
<lb/>The new generations ss-e owners of the future, for they bring the experiences
<lb/>of the past and the aims which tliey have constructed upon those exi^erfences.
<lb/>Youth carries withj_n itself the seed of all progress, and which mil sprout
<lb/>luxuriant and vigorous through good education. But of that education is not taken
<lb/>care of, or is deficient or twisted, far from developing, that seed will remain
<lb/>infertile and rotten. A bad education is like sea water on a plant, wliich it does
<lb/>not give life to, but kills,
<lb/>Paiii is for man what the crLiicible is for gold: it purifies it and enhances
<lb/>its value. In the transitorj^ life of tliis world, suffering wliich is well understood
<lb/>and borne is the greatest possible benefit, for when the spirit leaves this
<lb/>testing crucible, it leaves behind all its impurities and rises beyond the tomb
<lb/>shining with the virtues wlxLch its iripurities staned. Therefore, you who cry,
<lb/>believe Jesus when He said that you would be consoldd.
<lb/>To govern m.en well it is necessary to know their aptitudes and keep in mind
<lb/>their dominant passions, with the aim of taking advantage of the former and
<lb/>avoiding the latter, is they are harmful. It can truly be said that the science
<lb/>of governing consists in knoi-jing how to choose the appropriate men for the various
<lb/>public duties. An error commb-tted in the designation of a public functionary
<lb/>is a time calamit;/ for the state, if the designated person is of such rank that
<lb/>he can paralize the life of a whole peopile.
<lb/>A corrupt and usurping government exists only until the people open their
<lb/>eyi-es: then it arises, shakes its mane and throws- off the usurpers. I write domi
<lb/>this "shaving" because the mres have mde us know of the suiprising and rapid
<lb/>pold-tical transformation riiich the Ecuadorean people have caused in less than
<lb/>twenty days. ITnen the usujipers have eidiausted the patience of the people xi by/
<lb/>depreciations and abuses, tiiei-e is nothSng left for them but the exit door and flight.
<lb/>Children are the fd.owers xdnich perfume t'le home, the little birds which
<lb/>delight with their noisy/ chirping. They have not yet had time to alter their
<lb/>spiritual fluids with passions, and therefore are so attractive and charming.
<lb/>Proportionately/, as time passes, the spirit MsdaoxKxMiK awakens to the intuitive
<lb/>and uncfinsclous im.pulse of its past acqusitions and the character of the person
<lb/>begins to take shape. If during that state one neglects to direct those acqui
<lb/>sitions down the right road, a false direction is taken and good intentions come to
<lb/>ruin and bad ones prosper. Parents and teachers, keep this friendly/ admonition
<lb/>in mind.
<pb n="7" facs="#page-006"/>
<lb/>Peace is an effect, not a cause. I'Jhether for the home or the nation, peace
<lb/>comes from the harmony of ideas a:'d feelings, from the balance of the passions,
<lb/>T'Jhen Jesus said to his disciples; ''I leave you peace and I give you iify peacey
<lb/>He knew well that he had educated, that he had inspired, that He had morally
<lb/>cured those men, by the Influence of His word, and the powerful magnetic force
<lb/>of His will, to make of them workers of good and only of good. Therefore, peace
<lb/>will reign in the world when men have advanced morally to the point of doing good
<lb/>only for its own sake.Tliat time will be long in coming, but it is consoling to
<lb/>see that there is a clear movement towards that glorious goal.
<lb/>Health results from the balance of the organic functions; when that balance
<lb/>is upset, illness results. Therefore it is easier to preserve that balance than
<lb/>to recover it once it has been altered. Nature has created all while preserving a
<lb/>perfect equilibrium. It is :man tliat has upset it by the abuses of his passions,
<lb/>and from that come diseases. They will not be cured or avoided until man has
<lb/>advanced morally to the point of being able to dominate his passions. He will
<lb/>achieve this will he acJiieve when he has iddLumnated his inind with the facts
<lb/>of science and elevated his character by cultivating liis virtues.
<lb/>A day which passes without an act of kindlness is one less decoration on the
<lb/>building which we construct for the next life. And each day which passes with an
<lb/>act of evil is another damage or ruan for that building. The human spirit, without
<lb/>realizing, prepares with its thoughts and its deeds the future which awaits it
<lb/>beyond. Life here on Earth is but an arena for the struggles of tiie spirit,
<lb/>wherein are put to test its moral and intellectual strenghts. If these strengths
<lb/>have succeeded in elevating trie cliaracter, the spirit will have elaborated for
<lb/>its future life that which tlieolngians call "glory"; but if it has degraded and
<lb/>debased it with all sorts of crimes and vices, it will have prepared a hell nad
<lb/>a purgatory wiithin its own conscience.
<lb/>Philantl-iTQiDy is like the de&gt;r which falls on the sere leaves wliich grow in
<lb/>arid lands of a desert. IJithout those vivifying drops, life would indeed be
<lb/>a fallow land for the unfortunate. The rich man x-iio understands the torraents of
<lb/>poverty and comes to its relief unkowingly xmaters the myrtles and laureln of the
<lb/>precious crox-rn which he vrlll find x-roven by invisible hands on the other side of
<lb/>the grave. But it is necessary for this that this philantliropy be exercised in
<lb/>the x-iay that Jesus adm/lsed, that is, without the cymbals that stroke vanity.
<lb/>Pox/erty, if it is not cased by laziness, is a valuable experience for the man
<lb/>xiho understands tlaat he is paying the debts of his previous existences. It is a
<lb/>crucible xdiich purifies past x-xastes and excesses, but one must nbt bring that
<lb/>test to ru.in by the intemperanes of vice and the aggression of hatred, for then
<lb/>rather than paying the debt one x-jill have increased them at greater j.nterest.
<lb/>The poor man must be honest to aiortize liis debts x-rith bonds of patience and goodwill.

<lb/>The majority of life's disagreable things come from our oi-m errors, committed
<lb/>either in this life or in previous ones. The remedy lies in knowing how to stand them.
<lb/>Now that science has shorn us that we have lived many tiriES before on this planet,
<lb/>we have come to know that our beings in those past lives were the very same seeds
<lb/>which have come to fruit in the present. If, therefore, &gt;e are to be prudent or â tri.se,
<lb/>we should be content to taste that fruit wioEibkHrfftmbxlmTitKiiirhasnmnz^ even if it
<lb/>is bitter or acid.
<lb/>Wealth generall-V dulls the noble passions and sharpens the low and ignoble ones,
<lb/>and therefore it is the most trying test for those who ask for it or accept it.
<lb/>To have in ones ha:ads tliat most sought after element, with which all pleasures
<lb/>car be bought aid all the passions that predominate in thismaterial world can be
<lb/>satisfied, is to wield a double edged weapon which most often eventually cuts the
<lb/>one tiio is unable to use it correctly. Nonetheless, wealth, goading gi'eed,
<lb/>has served and is serving as a propulsive force for the progress of the icrldj
<lb/>it matters not that that sword is cutting the throat of the rich who hai'"e not known
<lb/>how to be rich well, humanity is continuing its march towards a period in which
<lb/>it tjill be knon-ffi how t o make good use of the wealth produced by work.
<lb/>Wlien work is scarce and difficult to find, and income is reduced, economy,
<lb/>ujiselj'- and caBeful]y managed, can save the family from the aigu.ish of poverty.
<lb/>Economy is for the poor man an escape Inatch whereby he can free himself from the
<lb/>aggression of pitiless iMigence. Poverty which is backed up bi^ honesty and
<lb/>good sense, far from being an evil as is generally believed, is a true blessing,
<lb/>for it shows man how to be moderate and compassionate. Wlio would believe it?
<lb/>The tru.e philanthropist is t' ;.e poor man, for uhe'i he protects he does it for
<lb/>the noble sentiment of coinpassion, Jesus told us of this KinBm. in the great
<lb/>parable of the tree of life.
<lb/>The people thjat reads is truly enlightened and consequently feapajiym fortu
<lb/>nate, because true happiness consists in the cultivation of the faculties of the
<lb/>spirit. But that people cannot read without having first attended school^ therefore,
<lb/>to make the people happy one must create good schools, and I say good schools
<lb/>because if at the time one is teaching reading in schools, one also fills the minds
<lb/>of children with shadows, that people t'/ill be benighted in the future, because
<lb/>shadows fetoyytmiw and quite dense ones are the different theories which the
<lb/>various sects have inx'^ented to cloud the prlnds of the people.
<lb/>February
<lb/>Time heals maiy of the ills of men, for it is the generator of experience,
<lb/>and this is the most effec'tlve panacea for the progress of the spirit.
<lb/>Each man brings to life the program which Tie must develop while he lives, ancf in
<lb/>that program is included the righting of his past errors, as well as the purpose
<lb/>of his future acquisitions. It is only by virtue of this debit and credit sheet that
<pb n="9" facs="#page-008"/>
<lb/>that the humn spirit is obliged to leave a balance in favor of its progress,,
<lb/>for otherwise it would endure a miserable life^ loaded alh-xays with debts, and
<lb/>tortured by desperate privations.
<lb/>It is a happiness to know that we are subraerged in the infinite ocean of
<lb/>Divine Nature^ of Universal Life and Energj'', on whose broad breast we carr;/ forth
<lb/>our eternal march towards perfection. bJlien Jesus r ecalled the words of the prophet
<lb/>who said " Ye are gods!,' it was because He kneia that we all come from the Father and
<lb/>towards Him we go in our ascending march towards perfection. Jesus was very e^qalicit
<lb/>when he announced to men this participation in divine nature because the Gospel is
<lb/>filled with grandiose promises of future happiness. The creation by man of a hell
<lb/>with eternal fire is a creation cursed by ignorance and the passion of men.
<lb/>A museum is perhaps of greater benefit to man than a library because the
<lb/>objective lessons one receives from a museum are more impressive than the leading
<lb/>of a book. In the great cities there the public authority has taken care to put
<lb/>before the eyes of the people the objects of nature, unconsciously and in a more
<lb/>agreeable and attractive manner tliat people instructs itself and enriches its
<lb/>intelligence tath facts Wiich perhaps would have been gleaned from books with greater
<lb/>difficulty. A man appreciates more quicl-cly^ just what a brontosaurus or a manmioth
<lb/>might have been like by viewing their skeletons than by reading scientific descriptions.
<lb/>In politics the force of public opinion is superior to that of armies, and
<lb/>therefore governments which are supported by the latter against the former are
<lb/>easily overtlirown. The reason for this sociological phenomenon is found in the
<lb/>Latin phrase mens agitat molem, i.e., intelligence dominates the mass. That which
<lb/>we call opinion is an operation of the intelligence wiiich brings conviction,
<lb/>and once convinced the people ar e capable of portents of courage and heroism.
<lb/>That operation is slow in people, which thereby sometimes lets itself be tyrannized
<lb/>for long years, but as soon as tiiil: peoTele opens its ej^'es to intelligence, it
<lb/>becomes irresistible.
<lb/>There are intelligences and invisible hands which direct humian affairs
<lb/>according to px*ovidential pla.ns witliout restraining the liberty of humans and in
<lb/>general without being noticed. "The spirit flies fmrmsmr wherever it will, and
<lb/>no one knows whence it comes nor whutjer it goes'.' Ifith these words Jesus spoke of
<lb/>that constant and'invisible action by invisible hands on the physical world.
<lb/>There is no re?Ligion or sect that does not adroit that influence upon humanity,
<lb/>but each explains this in its omn manner, but a!-1 are basically in agreement that
<lb/>this contact o-rlth the invisiblie does exist.
<lb/>The reciprocal influence between the visible and invisible to rids is the
<lb/>pooweriul force exercised by the lao-r of progress in the infinite universe. Iloen
<lb/>mariLrijid fao-iliarcizes itself with this idea and attempts to I'Sarn the lawrs wiiich
<lb/>control this communication, it will find life on 'bhis planet easier arid more
<lb/>beai'able, because it mil concentrate the reasons and purposes of this present

<lb/>existence, which ai'e none other than the understanding of the possibilities
<lb/>inherent in its nature, both physical and spiritual.
<lb/>The food, which least benefits the iiian who loves naturalness is that taken
<lb/>at a banquet, because the condiment of etiquette makes it disagreeable and indi-
<lb/>gestable. Social conventions are, in general, nothing more than a siraulation of
<lb/>feelings which are not really held, and they become unbearable for the sincere
<lb/>soul. A somple and perhaps Ens sparse meal, but seasoned with the affection of
<lb/>the faniily, is immensely more delicious and nutrotious than one taken in the midst
<lb/>of the tii-'esome formulas of social lefinement.
<lb/>m the tempests of life the best lifeboat is the serenity of the soul, which
<lb/>helps one to grasp firmly the redder of philosophical resignation. Those moral
<lb/>storms are as beneficial and ndcessary as the physical ones,for if the latter
<lb/>purify the atmosphere atid put the elements in balance, the former ones, those of
<lb/>the spirit, if one knows how to ride them out, bring in their i3aÂ±K[ wake the
<lb/>calm of a serene conscience, which has triumphed in life's struggle.
<lb/>In the seasons of life one should be able t o takeadvantage of the freshness
<lb/>and lushness of Spring and the vitality of Summer, in order to prepare onesself
<lb/>foÂ± the cold years of mntry old age. But ffiiS, unfortunately, untliinking youth
<lb/>squanders imprudently its vital force and prepares for itself a premnture old age,
<lb/>filled T-fith awful physical aches and moral remorse. This is due in great part to
<lb/>the lack of educating adolescents about their own nature, so that tliej^ may acquire
<lb/>a healthy respect for their procreative functions and p.rotect tjiereby^ the happiness
<lb/>of the home and tlie robustness of their descendants.
<lb/>nothing teaches nan so rriucli as the excesses and improvide-nces which have been
<lb/>so'-m only to liarvest displeasures ami sisencha'itmsnto when there is no hope of
<lb/>any relief. Mien one enjoys means which are more than sujTficient for the maintenance
<lb/>of onesself and one's family, those excess means are ofte.n spent of superfluous
<lb/>things, and one forgets that after good times bad ones can follow. But such are
<lb/>the ways of humajn nature, which has needof the hard lessons of experience to
<lb/>operate its own moral aid spiritual progress.
<lb/>The great secret for atti-acting the inspirational pro
<lb/>tection of invisible intelligences is the effort spent on swreetening one's per
<lb/>sonal character and, in being useful to others in all aspects of life. He wrho is
<lb/>more used to giving thai receivi-n.g ujiconsciously works to liis own advantage, for
<lb/>that beneficial current he eiFiits towrards others is bringing to him another equally

<lb/>Philosophical socialnisi Carries â vrithin it the seeds which mil trarjorm society^
<lb/>regenerating it. This healthy doctrine, despite the absurdities which have been
<lb/>attributed to it and the acts of violence which have stained it, is no more than
<lb/>the struggle of the worker for justice against the greed of the capitalist. It matters
<lb/>not that the capitalist have at his side the sophists of the pen as well as the
<lb/>allies of the sword; the sense of justice and the light of truth infiltrate society
<lb/>more every day, and when thesd forces iiave balanced those of irD^rmby: inequity,

<lb/>Despotism, mth its depredations and excesses, has always engendered revolutions
<lb/>in Latin Araerica; therefore the only xsray to make these revolutions disappear is
<lb/>to insure the rise of illustrated and honest governments. But this too camot be
<lb/>obtained until the people have been taught by a reasonable and non-sectarian system
<lb/>of education,the only kond that can make it zealous in protecting its rights and
<lb/>respectful and fulfaMling of its duties. The republica of France and the United
<lb/>States serve as a mirror in this regard. But even in these two great republics
<lb/>much remains to be done, in the schools as well as in the press, which are the two
<lb/>mail arteries which carr^^ the vitalizing blood of education throughout the body
<lb/>politic.
<lb/>Generosity amd clemency exercised towards the weak, the vanquished and the
<lb/>fallen, conquer love. Justice and energy shown to despots and usurpers frightens
<lb/>them, aid attracts the respect of the people. Tlierefore the necessity of choosing as
<lb/>magistrates men gifted with those qualities of character, the only ones that can
<lb/>insure the happiness of the people. -len who have as their motivation self interest;
<lb/>those who have shown tendencies towards despotism and cmuelty; those clothed only
<lb/>with Ie base and excessive passions, should be excluded from public service,
<lb/>because once they grasp power they become a tiw.e calamity for society.
<lb/>Cleanliness is the pleasure of the poor man. Sobriety and subjection to
<lb/>natural law should be the satisfaction of his needs and the cure for his illnesses.
<lb/>Poverty in and of itself is not an illness; the danger lies in its concomitant
<lb/>additives, such as ignorance, bad habits and disordered passions. Give the poor
<lb/>man education, teach liim good habits and elevating pasminHK and dignifying passions^
<lb/>and he w5_ll be happiest being on earth, for he will be healthy in body and scul.
<lb/>That e:rperience is a good schoolroom for man is â ^roved bp- his vehement and
<lb/>sincere wish to be able to return to his childhood, but with his reason taught by
<lb/>his e:qjerience. If one carefullp'' analizes those deeds which have occasioned happiness
<lb/>and wellbeing, one will .find that they have alroost all been the product of experience,
<lb/>which is the. great teacher of mankind. That wliich today pleases us and strikes us
<lb/>as excellent, tomorrow, we .find'childish and we are'almost ahsmaed that it pleased

<lb/>Civilization, to be a true one, must develop the physical man, illuminate
<lb/>him and above all make hirri moral; if any of these traits of civilization are
<lb/>absent, then it is a mutilated cmvilization. And for this aim is necessary a
<lb/>good education, to insure the harmonic development of the physical, intellectual
<lb/>and moral man. If one had to gove preference to any of these things, it would be
<lb/>to the moral development, for this alone creates virtues, and these are the pass
<lb/>port which perrits the human spirit to be a citizen of any superior world.
<lb/>T'Jhen civilization has succeeded in making the majority of mankind moral, the
<lb/>Earth mil have ceased to be a world of trial and expiation to be one of liappiness
<lb/>and progress. Though that goal is veiy distant, it will be acheived. Pertiaps

<lb/>Blind religious fariaticisrii is an irremediable a fault for the hui-oan soul,
<lb/>as a hunched back is for the physical man. Only reincarnation can make them
<lb/>disappear. Ehen I see a blindly fanatical people, I think: this is a race of
<lb/>hunchbacks and deformed people. The only effective orthopedics for such a people
<lb/>is lay schools, for the sectarian ones are precisely that wliich sows the seeds
<lb/>of these deformities of the soul. ITien I hear it said that someone has died
<lb/>comforted by the ministrations ofa religion, I exclaim with sadness: that poor

<lb/>'lore good is done for society by a single free man who obliges others to

<lb/>Romans who put up with a ITero. The contagion of abjectness causes the ruin of
<lb/>peoples for many generations, because the belittling and degradation of the
<lb/>character are as transmittable as leprosy or cancer. To have people who are free

<lb/>Evil is a purely negative entity. Just as darkness is but tie absence of
<lb/>light, and cold the lack of heat, so evil is but the absence of good. This is the
<lb/>supreine law of the universe, for it is but the very same divine nature, and all
<lb/>things and all beings are, live and move in this nature,as St. Paul said. If
<lb/>we do, or put up urith, that w"hi_ch we call evil, it is because we have abandoned that
<lb/>natural, universal law. Put su.ch a condition is transitory, because we all gravitate
<lb/>towards good, and sooner or later we must ad-1 follow th^t impulse unfailingly.
<lb/>By insisting on evil by our 0TÂ»m will, ue do but delay tlie mojnent in tfliivh we
<lb/>follow that impulse, but we urill follow it when trisdom enters our nature.
<lb/>Melody moves and elevates the soul n-.rhose fluids are harmonic. Not all ears
<lb/>are capable of perceiving the sublime vibrational combinations. A savage would be
<lb/>perhaps indifferent to a Beethoven sonata, but would be enthusiastic upon hearing
<lb/>the beating of drums and the sound of trurrpets. It is because the fluids of his
<lb/>soul and his nerves are made to respond to those vibrations, strong for him but
<lb/>perhaps alraost harxiiful to others. The human ear only functions in a certain
<lb/>range of vibrations, but the combinations are irJ'inite. And on that scale, not
<lb/>all men are equal. The purer a person's fluids, the better he perceives beauty.
<lb/>The weightiest and perhaps the most pleasant chains man endures on earth
<lb/>are children. For them are endured the greatest privations, the greatest sufferings
<lb/>are borne, the greatest dangers dared, and all obstacles overcome. Before children
<lb/>ferocity is softened and crime disarmed. Children are, then, the greatest ele
<lb/>ments of progress for the human spirit, for they are a classromraof alternating
<lb/>pleasures and sufferings, which develop moral strengths and purify the sentiments.
<lb/>FdLch and miserly people are their own executioners, because they impose
<lb/>upon themselves all sorts of privations and suf"eriu.gs, and wind up leaving
<lb/>their fortunes to be enjo^'Gd by otJiers. They are disturbed spirits who have grasped
<lb/>only the leaves of the radish, making wealth the aim of their lives odien it is but
<lb/>the means to live and to be useful to others. After an existence made miserable
<lb/>despite their welath, tliey awake on the other side of the tomb to see t giat their
<lb/>earthly life was a complete failure. Since it is extremely rare that those fortunes
<lb/>are inade by licit and honorable means, without knowinglj' iiarming othei's, such
<lb/>people find tbemselvesface to face writh their victoKis and discomfited by the
<lb/>inexorable remorse of their own consciences.
<lb/>The acquisition of virtue is a slow and difficult process for the spirit
<lb/>tliroughout its successive incarnations. IMien you see a huriian being who is kind,
<lb/>humble, patient, chartiable and abnegated, you can say with certaiinty that soul
<lb/>is very old, and lias passed tlirougli many reincarnations and sufferings mitil it has
<lb/>been purified and has achieved virtue. Jesus said: "Enter by the narrow door,

<lb/>Acqixiring virtue is harder thai acquiring Imowledge, for the former implies
<lb/>abnegation and personalsacrifice^ and the latter often makes one haughty.
<lb/>To be educated it suffices to go to colleges^ universities and libraries; but
<lb/>to be humble^ charitable aid kind, one must be faiiiLliar with hospitals, asylums,
<lb/>ambulances and calamities of all kinds. Moral progress is therefore more iraportant,
<lb/>for it is harder. True philanthropy comes out of the crucible of personal
<lb/>sacrifice and abnegation; false philantliropy often springs only from vanity.
<lb/>Dreams are not mere products of fantasy, as has been said, but rather real
<lb/>scehes tiiat the spirit has been present at in the invisible or fluid world.
<lb/>Such scenes are more or less clear and coherent according to the degree of
<lb/>progress of the spirit. Premonitory dreams which announce some occurrence are
<lb/>fluidic Ì legorical pictures which develop before the spirit favored by such an
<lb/>announcement. In any case, dreams are realities wliich pass before the spirit
<lb/>which has become unattached during sleep.
<lb/>Tlirough music we perceive -Sad, who impresses our auditoiy nerves with the
<lb/>delightful combinations of meter, the sublime vibrations of harmony, the divine
<lb/>mathematics. The genius of Pythagoras grasped that fact better than the rest of
<lb/>men, and therefore he spoke of the music of the spheres, for the universe is
<lb/>no more than a great synphony. From the infinitely small to the infinitely large,
<lb/>all creatures are notes in the infinite scale of God and contribite to the supreme
<lb/>harmony of the universe in the sublime orchestra udiose conductor is God. Only
<lb/>man can is capable of causing sour notes, by abusing his liberty, but he is
<lb/>obliged to repeat the note until it is played correctly'' and harraoniously.
<lb/>Reincarnation facilitates that labor.
<lb/>rlaen the transmission of thought has becorfie generalized among manlcind,
<lb/>haimanity will have reached a high degree of morality. Comonunication among huroan
<lb/>beings solely by thought will be an indication that they have advanced ;nTuch
<lb/>further than that epoch announced by Victor "Mgo, in Trhich all laws and codices
<lb/>will have been replaced by simple publicity, â ^lien humans sped&lt; through thought,
<lb/>they will have become angels incarnate, they who today are rather no more than
<lb/>devils incarnate.
<lb/>Men should reflect that the sums they spend on banquets, to honor peop7Le
<lb/>who have inore than enough to eat, should instead be spent on satisfying the Irunger
<lb/>of the unfortunate. That would be the greatest Indication of moral progress,
<lb/>and that men truly begin to love one another, which is to say thnt they begin
<lb/>to become Christians; Rut to invite those who are already satiated, when nearby
<lb/>there are peopVe who are dying of hunger and cold, is to prepare in the aften-Jorld
<lb/>that sentence whdich Jesus spoke of; "I iiungered, and ye fed me not: I thirsted

<lb/>Among the knom and applied forces^ none is as powerful as electricity,

<lb/>Since, according to the spiritualist doctrine, the planet Earth is a world
<lb/>of exp'iation and testing, there is no home nor individual, no mtter how happy
<lb/>others presume them to be, that doesnot have its sufferings. The only happy people,
<lb/>relatively speaking, are those who suffer their expiation writh serebity, and
<lb/>who triumph wiyy heroism over their trials, no matter how difficult. iJhen we see
<lb/>a beggar, a leper, g sick man, a hounded man, serene and resigned, we should think
<lb/>them happy because they are crowning their victory. Not in vain did Jesus say:

<lb/>Children, xd en they are little, give raorepleasurc than sorrow to their parentsj
<lb/>when they are young people, more sorrow thaic pleasure, until they have arrived at

<lb/>itself known, and nature wakens the passions dormant in the child. From x-jliich it
<lb/>follows that if one jias not liad the wisdom to elevate the character of the cliild,
<lb/>by wax- of a sensible education that has as its foundation truth and ffanlcness,
<lb/>the young person, upon feeling the spurring of those passions, x-rill tlirow liimself

<lb/>you go and buy it, perhaps unwittingly, because you have been dragged along by
<lb/>mental suggestion, ilien I see imraense fortunes rise up as the result, merely, of

<lb/>A smile is a maxpietic discharge which a pleased soul transmits to the facial
<lb/>muscles, to shoxj others its pleasure. Hence, a smiling face generally wins the
<lb/>affections of thers and infects them with its good humor. On the other hand, a
<lb/>frown is a repulsive magnetism rrhich annoys others aiid scLietiraes occasions disastrous
<lb/>explosions. Nature has marked faees with characteristic traits to produce that
<lb/>which we call sympathy oi-" antipathy. Those faces are, therefore, positive or

<lb/>Humanity cannot advance intellectually or moral-ly until all people have enough
<lb/>for the material life^ and equality lias assured the rights of all people by the
<lb/>law of just compensation. Current social orgai ization is an insult to justice,
<lb/>for in general, egotism and self interest ha"e been the motivating factor behind
<lb/>human actions. And so we constantly hear praises raised to capital, which tramples
<lb/>on the rights of the weak and the poor. This social upset will change when the
<lb/>State educates the people in one common system which gives to all the same oppor
<lb/>tunities to improve their living conditions.
<lb/>As advantageous as the social position and fincnoial state of a man might be,
<lb/>if he doesnot ioossess peace in his soul, that loeace which Jesus left to His dis
<lb/>ciples, that is, perfect control overthe passions and the harmony of thesoul
<lb/>with nature, that riian will aways be in iirariinent danger ofoeing a victiai of laoral
<lb/>catastrophes. The peace of the soul is only enjoyed by those happy beings who
<lb/>gained tranquility in tlieir own consciences by means of the practice of virtue.
<lb/>Those souls exercised in the wld-lbeing of others are the only ones who enjoy
<lb/>peace, no matter what the surrounding circumstances may be.

<lb/>Today I saw some engravings of works by the mbst famous European painters
<lb/>which showed women who were completely nude. In the presence of so much natural
<lb/>beauty^ this interesting question came to my mind: How did the human species
<lb/>develop that delicate sentiment Imown as shame? The lower animals do not have it;
<lb/>it starts to show itself in some so-called savage tribes; children among more
<lb/>civilized peoples also lack it in their early years^ that is to say before their
<lb/>reason is functioning and the awareness is awakened. Tliis gives one license to
<lb/>thinkj then, that Nature has placed tills sentiment in rnanJcind to separate it
<lb/>bit by bit from the levels of animals. It is clear that the more man has progressed
<lb/>in his moral education, the more exquisite is this feeling. INien man has succeeded
<lb/>in dominating his carnal passions, he will be more able to enjoy the beauty of nudity.
<lb/>There is no doubt that melody puts us in communication wiHi the invisible
<lb/>universe, and mates us enter into hainnony with Nature, mnking our owii fluids
<lb/>vibrate deliciously. For that reason music has been used more and more in the
<lb/>treatment of neim^ous conditions, which are but fluidic discords of the nerves.
<lb/>Tlie more the human being has been elevated spiritually, the more sensitive he
<lb/>is towards muwrK melody,* therefore classical music has been applied also as
<lb/>a most efficient means of moralization.
<lb/>In great public calamities one sees arise spontaneously the feeling of
<lb/>comrlseration for the victims. This general sentiment is a greatisve of fra
<lb/>ternity which shows thatthe basic essence of human nature is good, since it derives
<lb/>from divine nature. If in normal social life there exist indifference, greed,
<lb/>avarice, cruelty and al. 1 the base passions that come from egotism, it is becaise
<lb/>manlcind, its reason clouded by the exigencies of the "I'' in the daily struggles
<lb/>of life, has forgottentiat it is all one big family, that in the liappiness and
<lb/>wellbeing of all are included those of each person. I'ithout the recent cala mity

<lb/>Nothing has contrj-buted more to rralning men proud and keeping people divided
<lb/>into classes, dominated by the so-called upper classes, than the unhappy habit
<lb/>of using, in i-rriting and speech, false and exaggerated titles. Most excellent
<lb/>Sir, Most iddLustrious Sir, Your teccellency, Your Eminence, Your Holiness, etc.,
<lb/>used in writing to and vspealcing to people who perhaps are not excellent, ill.ust-
<lb/>rious, nor emD.nent, nor holy, but perhaps even exactly the contrary, is hut to
<lb/>perpetuate lies and set up adulation as a norm. Let my protest be known, then,
<lb/>frankly and ingenuously, against these linguistic abuses against truth and justice.
<lb/>The scientific study of fluidic emanations or auras is proving that according

<lb/>Blinded by the desire for wealth, we have made life factitious, ceasing
<lb/>almost completely to enjoy the delights offered to us by provident Mature,
<lb/>lie have forgotten that igealth is just a mnans of living and not the object or
<lb/>aim of life. Hence, we have become slaves to work and upset the natural social
<lb/>order. But there are signs now that men are returning to the simple life: this

<lb/>I wasi-alking with a respected friend of mine, of Scottish origin, along a
<lb/>street where they had just finished building a sumptuous church, and xMen I
<lb/>mentioned to him tliat the church had been built through private subscriptions,
<lb/>he answered; "Here is a completely useless building, but the subscribers have
<lb/>a perfect right to waste their money'; Tnese few words gave me the measure of the
<lb/>good common sense and respect for others's rights so injiate in the Anglo-Saxon race.
<lb/>As children, have you ever a;-:iused yourselves by playing with iron filings and
<lb/>a magnetized needle? That which we call a IcLss obeys the same law. Of all the organs
<lb/>of the human body the eyes and the lips are charged mth a special magnetism of
<lb/>powerful strength. That is why the eyes seek eachother out and frequently penetrate
<lb/>eachother; that s vrhy the lips join together obeying the irresistible law of
<lb/>attraction. This jaw is universal, and unawares we all obey it in different ways.
<lb/>The kiss is a magnetic attraction that seduces us, but on condition that it be
<lb/>sincerely felt. Hisses like that of Judas are aboiMnations because they transgress

<lb/>If poverty and misery exist in the world, it is because the time has not yet

<lb/>Hearing on a friend's phonograph a melodious song acconpanied by violin

<lb/>capturing those sounds forever to be able to replay them at 10.11, That oonfiirmed

<lb/>Theoligians have made God in their image, and since they have their

<lb/>injustice. But, according to the spiritualist doctrine, grace for the human soul
<lb/>is the degree of progress realized, which has made it the creditor of the gift

<lb/>While reading today in "Lumen" of the strange and brilliant ceremonies
<lb/>which in India have accor5)aaied the arrival of the Prince and Princess of Wales,
<lb/>I felt moved mentally to protest aganst this example of human deification.
<lb/>But after reflecting that after all this was bmt anacample of human evolution,
<lb/>that all this apparatus of truly oriental luxury is the homage rendered by an

<lb/>bessenlhat this demonstration was not properly for the Prince and Princess,
<lb/>but for the puissant race of Shakespeare, Cj.omwell, Nelson, Wellington, Daiwin,

<lb/>so go along just as gods have, and in the future these demonstrations will only

<lb/>Today, Sunday, I went very early to my church. Prospect Park, to render
<lb/>homage to my god of nature, and when I had arrived at the statuB of Abraham
<lb/>Lincoln, iry sight was attracted by the groups of beautiful thou^ts which the
<lb/>gardeners had tastefully arranged in the vicinity of the statue, and I felt it
<lb/>my duty to dedicate also a humble spriiig, and I said; "Oh, great Lincoln, whose
<lb/>providential destiny it â was to act in an efficient manner to gove liberty to the
<lb/>negro race that lay crying in slavery, now that your spirit has gained possession
<lb/>of bm-fcfinairry greater faculties and better possibilities, I ask you to cooperate
<lb/>actively to free the white race, which lies sunk in the worst of slaveries, that
<lb/>of the passions, the mpst peraicious being that of insatiable thrist for gold
<lb/>which so ddiminates your race. That passion of itself engenders others far more
<lb/>disastrous, such as inl-custice, cold indifference towards poverty, the exploitation
<lb/>of thÂ© worker, of women and children, the corruption of legislators and judges.
<lb/>Save, Oh Lincoln, save your own racei In that wonderful work you will have the
<lb/>unfailingly efficient cooperation of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and Grant
<lb/>and other superior spirits who raised up this great nation. Amen','
<lb/>Have you ever heard in the great theatres aid halls of New York those
<lb/>wondrous concerts played by two or three hundred musicians? That will give you
<lb/>an idea of what society will be like when it is ruled in strict conformity with
<lb/>perfect tuning of all the social classes will arise that greatest harmony, with
<lb/>not one false note. Without the bassi, which with their profound aid grave
<pb n="28" facs="#page-027"/>
<lb/>sounds form the foundation of the orchestra, there vould be no concert; so
<lb/>similarly, without the people who form the base of society, there would be no
<lb/>society. The director who grasps the baton is the governor who indicates to
<lb/>each and every social class the form and the moment of their participation.
<lb/>But think for a moment what society is like now, that all the classes attack
<lb/>eachother and run about with no order or arrangement, and you will realize that
<lb/>we live sru^rounded by cacophony that is unceasing.
<lb/>Today there were several of us reading on the blackboard of the Evening Mail
<lb/>the news which that daily paper presents to the passersby on Broadway, and since
<lb/>that blackboard is at street level, each of us tried not ti irpede his neighbor's
<lb/>reading. A boy came forward, and without taking aây notice of everybody else's
<lb/>right to read the blackboard, covered it up with nis body, got in the way. Then
<lb/>a rather athletic reader took the boy by the arm and gave him a slap on the head
<lb/>that made him move away. As I continued ray walk I thought that this is what happens
<lb/>to those who don't respectthe ri^ts of others, and I remembered at the s ame
<lb/>time certain rulers in Latin America, to whom the people did just what the man
<lb/>did to the boy.
<lb/>Today in Prospect Park I greeted the first winged migrants who have come
<lb/>from the South, from that land of heat and oranges. They were the first troubadours
<lb/>who have rushed to raise their sweetest voices to the goddess of Spring, radiant
<lb/>with life and beauty. Oh splendid Natiirel How few contemplate you aid enjoy you
<lb/>when the sun has barely risen above the horizon, and how they bring your charms to

<lb/>signs now that men are seeking out your charms again.
<lb/>Humanity strides along, unwittingly, moved by the force of that great power
<lb/>which, lacking a better definitionm has become known a s acfck suggestion, and
<lb/>which in the intellectui and mor^ spheres is like that other irresistable force
<lb/>which in the physical sphere is known as attraction. Habits, customs, education,
<lb/>preoccupations, tradition, everything which charms and moves mankind, operates
<lb/>under the influence of that mysterious force. But of all the ideas of the human
<lb/>ppirit, there is none so strongm so powerfiil, so tenacious and so blind as
<lb/>religious fanaticism, becaise it is exercised in the name of divinity. Thence,
<lb/>the terrible resistance it shows towards the findings of science and the dictates
<lb/>of enlightened reason.
<lb/>Society should walk toxrards ots perfection in the same way as hundreds of
<lb/>thousands of people walk daily along Broadway, which is the spinal colxunn
<lb/>of New York, All go along at a business-like pace, that is, in a rush, but
<lb/>xd.thout crashing into or harming one another in that great maremagnum of men and
<lb/>women, old and young sfid vehicles of all types, so that it is a drairable and sxir-
<lb/>prising that accidents and mishaps do not mccur at every moment. The same widi
<lb/>that each person has of moxring along and arrixring afc his destination through all
<lb/>the dangers has made each develop moves and skill to avoid collisions. The classes
<pb n="29" facs="#page-028"/>
<lb/>of society should all inarch in a similar way, without interfering with or harming
<lb/>eachother. Rulers are like the policemen on Broadway, who direct the march and
<lb/>direction of vehicles to avoid accidents and clashes.
<lb/>The fundamental basis, the axle on which human history turns, Â±s has been and

<lb/>If, in the moral sphere, we were to hold to the Darwininan principle tha%"the strug
<lb/>gle for existence, either for the individual or the entire species, the fittest
<lb/>alone are to survive, humanity would be in a fine state indeed if only the fools
<lb/>and the soundrels were to prevail. But fortunately it can be^en that the p irre-
<lb/>sistable tendency of this period is in favor of the peaceful ones and of those
<lb/>who have dignified love. This is because the moral progress of the spirit is
<lb/>tru]y a universal law.
<lb/>Each human being holds in his make-up the physical elelemnets which are
<lb/>appropriatw for his own struggle in the environment vdaich hw has chosen or
<lb/>which has been imposed on him, and hriH each holds in his spirit the faculties,
<lb/>the vices or the virtues acquired in his past existences, and which should work
<lb/>according to the mission or program of each person's life. Only thusly is it
<lb/>possible to expilain the incoitgirehensible differences among human beings and their
<lb/>diverse fates. Nobody could have guessed that a humble swineherd boy would come a
<lb/>Sixtus V, or that a humble woodsman would be a lincoln, just as nobody has to
<lb/>date been able to explain why, of two brothers bom and raised in s imilar circum
<lb/>stances, one has notable intelligence and the other complete imbecility.
<lb/>Hasre you ever been, in the calmness of a Sunday, in the middle of a woods,
<lb/>under the protecting shade of centuries old trees, with no other noises but the
<lb/>babbling of the water, the rustling of the wind and the song of birds? Well, there
<lb/>one communes with God in a manner different from the dizzying movement of the
<lb/>people who rush to catch trains and trolley cars on Brooklyn Bridge, in that
<lb/>daily wave-motion of work, that wave-motion of the social struggle to make a living.
<lb/>In the first scene you put yourself in relation with the universe and you converse
<lb/>mentally with the invisible beings who abound in tpace. In the second, if you are

<lb/>and active people.
<lb/>The American woman, when she stepped for the first time on the shores of

<lb/>together with the conviction of her true libertjr, the pure air of the American
<lb/>forests, she became a more pleasant and intelligent type of wmman, who educates
<lb/>and gives iitpetus to that peqile in accordance with her great destiny. Mothers

<lb/>More good has been done for mankind by the first grist mill than bu the
<lb/>Summa of St, Thomas, The former gave man his daily bread, while the latter has
<lb/>Eteiyi only served to misguide and confuse human reason. Of greater benefit is,
<lb/>I think, the philosophy which one gleans from a machine than all the wisdom

<lb/>heairt there lies hidden the kindness which Nature put there and which social
<lb/>conventions have covered up. Self-interested hypocrisy is only the enemyof the

<lb/>Dueling,
<lb/>MoHnnmHB, whish still eocLsts in some ddvanced societies, is a sad rem

<lb/>festation of human pride. Since man fanrioi! does not have complete control over his
<lb/>passions, which is of course the ideal of moral progress, when he is offended,
<lb/>his jqjidey which he calls his honor, is wounded, and he thinks himself duty-bound
<lb/>to bathe it in blood to cleanse it in the view of a society which has lost its
<lb/>moral concept. The daily chronicles of England, Germany, the Ikdted States record
<lb/>only rarely eh examples of duels among people of the upper classes. Today I have
<lb/>read of one such case in France,
<lb/>Would you know the degree of morality of a people? Read its novels, wherein
<lb/>you will find quite healthy the most disastrous passions, in the peoples whose
<lb/>writers have sacrificed morality for the craving of money, love, thr reigning
<lb/>passion of the human heart, you will find dragging itself throu^i the base mud
<lb/>with the sole purpose of attracting readers, pleasing thusly the seductive in
<lb/>stinct of carnal lust. But where the writers have understood the moral duty to
<lb/>dignify the character, as the best means of raising the moral level of their people,
<lb/>in their novels you will see love ennobled within the limits of self-respect
<lb/>and social dignity. These novelists vho propagate virtue are insuring for society
<lb/>a happier future through the enchantment of their idealistic creations.
<lb/>The most deeply rooted and the most univsreal passion of the humanheart is
<lb/>vanity. If you carefully analize human actions and things, you will everywhere

<lb/>they all taj'e rcot ixi this suggestive passion which has infiltrated very deeply
<lb/>into society. How justified is the wiseman who left us in Scripture this great
<lb/>maxim: "Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas'j
<lb/>What has contrubuted the most to perpetuate in society pride, sloth and
<lb/>bad habits is inheritance, legacies. A misguided and egotistical paternal love
<lb/>startedthe habit, afterwards elevated to law in legal codices, of leaving to the
<lb/>children the fruits of the labors of the fathers, vjho were happy with the idea
<lb/>that their children should enjoy their riches, and who perhaps neglected entirely
<lb/>to educate them in the habits of work. Happily it is now a widespread habit that
<lb/>the State impose conditions upon and limit the ability to leave bequests. The best
<lb/>modern thinkers have seen that the worst social ills arise from that blind and
<lb/>unconditional right of transmitting property, because it percerts filial love by
<lb/>sapping the bases of strict justice. The world derives greater benefits from the
<lb/>working classes than from the hoarders of inheritances.
<lb/>It is an e:3cellent rule Â£ hygiene that the Romans left us in the phiase
<lb/>roens sana in dano corpore, (which is to say that physical development must be
<lb/>harmonious with the intellectual), Americans have exaggerated the physical de
<lb/>velopment to the point of arriving at pugilism, viiich is the sorest wound that
<lb/>afflicts the fair Anglo-Saxon race. The American perhaps prefers to develop the
<lb/>muscles to the detriment of the intellect and the atrophy of the moral fiber.
<lb/>But one nowadays sees a tendency to establish an equilibrium of harmony in the
<lb/>methods of public instruction, which will bring as a insult a race vigojrous in
<lb/>its triple physical, intelDe ctual and moral concept.
<lb/>Humanity has not yet left its childhood, but here and there can be seen
<lb/>trases of maturity. It is still entertained by the royal scenes of which we have
<lb/>read in childhood inaEksx stories. When a king is married or crowned, the whole
<lb/>world is moved, and the press, the universal organ for the manifestations of
<lb/>social life, for many dgs^s fills its columns with the abundant material provided
<lb/>by those ceremonies which exhausted the splendour and pomp of what is called the
<lb/>great world. Such clowning and foolishness still prevail in the theater. Women
<lb/>still go crazy for baubles and jewels which are nothing more than the somewhat
<lb/>advanced evolution of the feathers and paints of our ancestors in the jiingles.
<lb/>Therefore, when, on subways or trolleys, I succeed in seeing a young woman whose
<lb/>ears are not pierced, I am filled with pleasure because it strikes me as a sign
<lb/>of mattirity, of common sense.
<lb/>If the governments of the Latin republics of America, which pride them
<lb/>selves as Catholic, had vouchsafed to their peoples works of charity: fed the
<lb/>hungry and given the thirsty to drink, that is to s^, if they had given
<lb/>abundantly good schools and libraries, the fate of those people would have been
<lb/>quite different, for education os the basis of morality and with this men become

<lb/>Iri the school of life, each day is but another lesson which man must learn
<lb/>to prepare himself for the difficult proof of his exam. If he has let a day pass

<lb/>I can find a material proof of the narrow and twisted spirit which prevailed
<lb/>in the Middle Ages in the narrow and twisted streets of d. 1 the cities which were
<lb/>foimded in the American colonies shortly after the Discovery. A notable contrast
<lb/>is seen between what the Americans call down-town, that is, the lower, nairow &amp;
<lb/>twisted part of their principal cities, and the new and more modem part, up-town,
<lb/>whose streets are wide and straight. In this sin^Jle observation the law of human

<lb/>industries so pernicious for humanity in that they foment the worst vices against
<lb/>health and morality. Mind you, there a re taverns, notwithstanding thair sumptions
<lb/>decoration and high-sounding names such as dub, casino, saloojfi,etc.,that are
<lb/>still just plain taverns and brothels. Those who speculate in these industries, when
<lb/>they leave this eardy existence and find themselves face to face with their own
<lb/>consciences in the regions of silence and solitude, will see before them with
<lb/>awful clarity the victims that they made with their lucrative industries. Then
<lb/>will be heard the "crying and gnashing of teeth" of which the Gospel speaks.
<lb/>Have you ever sat beside a picturesque brook, which runs along babbling
<lb/>and striking with its chrystalline waters the stones it finds along its path?
<lb/>Have you ever pondered that those noisy drops of water never stop and never go
<lb/>backwards, or climb back up the softly sloping surface from which they came
<lb/>in accordance xith the law of gravityiff, which carries them to join their waters
<lb/>with other waters they encounter on their incessant travels until they are pre
<lb/>cipitated into the immense ocean, where they contribute to form the powerful
<lb/>and mighty and imposing waves? Well, there you have the live image of universal
<lb/>life, which drags beings along on t he incessant march of pregress and throu^
<lb/>infinite transformations, towards the ocean of d 1 kindness, of all beauty and of
<lb/>all treth that we call God. Those beings, like the droplets asf the brook, had their
<lb/>origin in that same infinite ocean iiy in the mysterious and incomprehensible
<lb/>evaporation of their substance, only to be condensed into that imperceptible drople t
<lb/>which goes along growing and perfecting itself unceasingly, until it once again
<lb/>takes part in the sublime and majestic waves of life, of light and of beauty which
<lb/>we call Nature.

<lb/>There is no doubt that a civilized society, after it has exhausted the
<lb/>refinements that a sensual nature has created in it, will have to go back to
<lb/>Mother Nature. Just as it has mistaken its nourishment and is now consuming an
<lb/>infinity of things that harm the organism and cause nervous and organic illnesses,
<lb/>it has also mistaken its apparel, which has become a copious fotintain of physical
<lb/>and even mental frailties. The perfidious corset, aid other sashes which ccjtpress
<lb/>the abdominal organs, have brought to the fair sex the dislocation of the vital
<lb/>organs, producing dangerous congestions which exhaust their nervous fluid. High
<lb/>heels and pointy toes on shoes,which dislocate at every step the body's center of
<lb/>gravity, are bringing about the same effect and deforming feet as well.
<lb/>Carefully observing t^se immense Americancfepartment stores, where the
<lb/>consumer finds everything imraaginable, from coal and firewood to article of the
<lb/>greatest luxury and value; where the purchaser can come in in the morning and
<lb/>seek out his needs, and spend the entire day selecting and prdering that whatever
<lb/>he needs be delivered; where he has at his reach restaurants to eat in, salons
<lb/>for sitting and chatting, reading newspapers and having some refreshments, post
<lb/>office, tele graph aid wire office, dockshop and photographer's studio, wherein,
<lb/>finally, the American has proposed to exhibit all that civilization has invented
<lb/>to make human life comfortable; observing all this I've come to think that perhaps
<lb/>60% of an the things that the human being worries about aid feels he must have
<lb/>will have to be put aside, as unnecessary, perhaps a century from now, when society
<lb/>obeys with greater respect the natural law, which shouts at it for greater
<lb/>sensibleness in life and fewer abuses in personal habits.
<lb/>The Americans also have their Day of the Dead (Decoration Day), but how
<lb/>different from that of the Latin, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman countries!
<lb/>Wiereas in the latter the Bay of the Dead consists of going to cemeteries and
<lb/>having priests, supplied with holy water, sing responses in Latin for the re
<lb/>pose of the sould which are perhaps frying in Purgatory, the Americans dedicate
<lb/>Jfey 30 to remembering those who have sacrificed themselves for the common good,
<lb/>and they organize all kinds of demonstrations for them, such as army and navy
<lb/>parades and processions of vaidous associations carrying flags, wreaths and
<lb/>inscriptions. On this day all the statues in the public parks and squares are
<lb/>decorded with little flags, crowns and flowers, so that the children of the
<lb/>people get accustomed to venerate the memory of heroes, wisemenand benefactors.
<lb/>Horrible] In the midst of the pon^ and splendor with which in Jfedrid the

<lb/>the Royal couple, who escaped unharmed, though I6 people in the ctowd were killed
<lb/>and 60 injured. Doubtless some criminal insanity has become emdemic among a certain
<lb/>social clasÂ® which has twisted its judgment and perverted all human sentiment.
<lb/>But if we cCTicentrate for a moment on the real causes of this mental upset, a
<lb/>frigjitening question arises. Is it not true that the worshippers of Ì ammon aer the
<pb n="34" facs="#page-033"/>
<lb/>the first ones to upset all notion of justice, corrupting characters and
<lb/>habits, forming iniquitous alliances with the religious and political powers
<lb/>on Earth to insure the success of their infernal program of exploitation of
<lb/>man by man? The pendulum is beginning to come back from the point to which it
<lb/>was taken by abuses, usurpations and base human passions.
<lb/>When we see full the colleges, schools and libraries, shops and factories,
<lb/>we will also see enpty the barracks and the churches, hospitals, prisons and
<lb/>taverns. Then all the fields will be under cultivation, all social classes
<lb/>levelled, with their respective necessities satisfied^ courts will have dis
<lb/>appeared and human fraternity will have realized the paradise lost through
<lb/>egotistical passions. The seers of the Earth have called that time the
<lb/>Mlennium, But to get there our distant descendahts will still be horrified
<lb/>by the social disasters unchained by insatiable human greed.
<lb/>All men have had their Lauraand their Beatrice. Ifrihappy is he whose youth
<lb/>has not been graced with the charms of m iddal love, sprung from the gaze of
<lb/>a woman who was for him as the North Star to the navigators of old, that is, the
<lb/>being which attracted his constant gazes because sheras the hope of his dreams.
<lb/>And Tdiat is the cause of that irresistable attraction between two beings who
<lb/>exchange the fluids that penetrate the soul? Doubtless they are reminiscences
<lb/>of a past which left roots which sprout upon contact with such fluids. It is a
<lb/>law that in the perennial transformation of universal life beings must unite
<lb/>in 03?der to progress throu^ the change of their emotions, their ideas and their
<lb/>thoughts. This, in the deficient language of humans, is called synpathy (enpathy),
<lb/>Today as I heard a churchbell which with its sonorous insistence was deter
<lb/>mined to convoke people for services vhich are called religious, the following
<lb/>occurred to me: churches, "vdiich can no longer attract the faithfhl with unctions
<lb/>andieligious spirit as they did in the time of the Apostles, are attracting
<lb/>them now by the impressions of the sensesj little by little the ceremonies of the
<lb/>various cukts are becoming true theatrical performances. Better that way, for we
<lb/>already have aggeeable vocal and orchestral concerts, splendid e3positions and
<lb/>charity fairs, and we shall soon see, in the very precincts of prayer, famous
<lb/>dances of the same type, for it is necessary to feed the hungry and clothe the
<lb/>naked at the cost of sweet kisses and seductive gallantries. Ah, Voltaire!

<lb/>Sexual ardor in the human species is the disastrous passion that has its
<lb/>origin in sexual pleasure. It is the moral passion which begins to be terribly
<lb/>noticeable in the higher animals, and idiidi in man has given rise to everything
<lb/>from polygamy to murder. Othello is the living representation of this sexual
<lb/>egotism which the English genius showed to the world, moving it deeply. As
<lb/>modem man acquires mastery over his carnal instincts and elevates his feelings
<pb n="35" facs="#page-034"/>
<lb/>through a more spiritual e ducation, ardour, lust, vanishes with the dignification
<lb/>of the character and the enlightenment of the intelligence. The material for
<lb/>this "shaving" was provided by two ferocious cats who last night interrupted my
<lb/>slumber.
<lb/>Remove from the United States the auri sacra fames which is corrupting it all,
<lb/>from business to politics, justice and legislation; remove the lynchings which
<lb/>through hatred for the black race is making it a natibn of murderers; take away
<lb/>the brutalities of football and boxing which, under pretext of physical development,
<lb/>is making them into barbarians; take away the rudeness a nd discourteous wsys of the
<lb/>common people and leave them the r suiprising commercial and industrial activity,
<lb/>their cult of liberty aid education, their incoBparable genius for mechanical
<lb/>things, their feverish attachment to work which has incubab ed the four thousand
<lb/>multi-millionaires which this country currently has, and you will be able to
<lb/>form a rough idea of the colossal possibilities which await humanity in the future.
<lb/>This "shaving" was planed while on Broadway passing by the construction s ite of
<lb/>one of those colossal, immense casas-torres (the word skyscraper didn't yet exist -Ed.)
<lb/>of this city, veritable human beehives wherein is made and runs in torrents the
<lb/>delicious honey they call the dollar.
<lb/>Today I have had a graphic representation of what in human society
<lb/>authority is and should be. Something had happened which altered for a moment the
<lb/>order and admirable precision with which move the trains which every morning
<lb/>carry rivers of people to work in New York (Jfenhattan), and becaise of that the
<lb/>crowds of people ontie platforms of the Brooklyn Bridge stations were immense.
<lb/>As I went down one of the staircases I saw a woman who carried a beautiful baby
<lb/>in her aimis. Then from the midst of the crowd I s aw suddenly appear the iir^^osing
<lb/>foim of a policeman who extended his vffigorous hand to protect the lady from the
<lb/>inconsiderate shovings of the rowdy and inconsiderate mob. I thought the strong
<lb/>hand in the white glove was the perfect sjrmbol of the pidnciple of authority.
<lb/>The glove should be white, for purity and probity, and strong, to preserve
<lb/>order and protect the weak. But unfortunately we still see that that hand often
<lb/>instead of white, is black, and instead of protecting the people it pushes them
<lb/>to the abyss of disorder and revolt.
<lb/>Among all the earthly creatures, man is the most exquisite organization,
<lb/>and even more so is womm, the veritable human mimosa; she is, one could day,
<lb/>a bundle ofi delicate neive endings. Â¥ell then, because of this organization
<lb/>in the human species, in its social evolution it finds itself in a fully
<lb/>sensational period, and its current habits, customs and tastes are bom of
<lb/>sensation. In its nourishment it has not limited itself to repairing its
<lb/>organic eleraents, spent in the play of life; stimulants of all kinds fill
<lb/>the list of its food and drink. In its clothing, this sensation has also
<lb/>created fashions, which are the school of iirposed and enforced tastes.
<lb/>Luxury is nothing more than sensation carried to the ultimate extreme. In
<lb/>everything man isdragged along by sensation and the passions it creates.
<lb/>Happily, one can see that simulÂ±aneously the period of intellectuality is quite
<lb/>advanced. There are many more now who prefer the notirishment of ideas to that
<lb/>which only satisfies the stomach, and many more too who prefer to dress them
<lb/>selves xri-th education rather than with delicate and fine cloths. Two centuries
<lb/>more and the time of sensation will ha\^e given way to that of the spirit.

<lb/>Today I haYe given a kiss with my pituitary membrane and another with my
<lb/>retina. Believe me when I affirm that I have not said anything foolish, but a
<lb/>truth as sturdy as a temple. I shall explain. What is a kiss? I think I said
<lb/>it already in another "shaving"; it is the attraction of two lips, that is the
<lb/>exchanging of the fluids invisible but deliciously felt that those lips contain.
<lb/>Well then, today I was walking along the paths in the ixise garden of Prospect
<lb/>Park, and enjoying the sight of the various kinds of roses artistically culti
<lb/>vated there each Spring. Upon seeing there two beautiful roses, one white and
<lb/>the other red, I couldn't help myself, and I leaned over to smell the aroma.
<lb/>When I raised my sight my eyes encountered two beautiful yound ladies who were
<lb/>walking along the same paths, and the luminous fluid they gave off pleasantly
<lb/>wounded my retina. Was I wrong, then, when I said I had kissed with both my
<lb/>olfactory and my optic nerves?
<lb/>What is most characteristic of Catholicism, in the world's educated and
<lb/>sensible opinion, is the blind and counterproductive war which the papacy has
<lb/>taken up against Socialism and Freemasonry, those two modem trends of the human
<lb/>spirit towards the inperium of practicable justice and brotherhood. In speaking
<lb/>of Socialism and Freemansonry I refer not to the false concepts propagated by
<lb/>their misguided and superficial adherents, who follow on the one hand an ideal
<lb/>social equality which is absurdji unnatural, impractical and iitposed by violence,
<lb/>and on the other hand a blind war against the clergy which is as egotistical
<lb/>and intransigeant as the clergy's against it. I refer instead to the im wholesome
<lb/>and philosophical doctrine of Socialism, which longs to see humanity freed Prom
<lb/>the irritating abuses created by human greed, and governed by order and justice.
<lb/>By practicable justice and brotherhood I refer to those characteristics with
<lb/>which Freemasonry is alleviating suffering humanity. It is in that sense that
<lb/>I would like to be both a socialist and a Freemason.
<lb/>I have just read a cable from the Vatican which denies that Pope Pius X
<lb/>intends to go to the papal villa of Castel Gandolfo,vecause he does not want
<lb/>to break his imprisonment in the Vatican. Now I ask myself, who has obliged him
<lb/>to such a long and strict imprisonment? And my serene reflexion ansvrers: it is
<lb/>that tyrant known as human pride. Let us recall history.As the centuriespassed,
<lb/>the Popes forgot so completely the teachings of the gentle and humble Jesus that
<lb/>they set themselves up x not only as kings of Christendom, beca'^se of their
<lb/>moral dominance in the entire world, but also started to think of themselves as
<lb/>temporal kings of Rome, thusly usurping the rights of the Italian civil goveimment
<lb/>and keeping noble and magnanimous Italy fragmented and in constant internal strife.
<lb/>But in 1870 the people triumphed and recovered its ri^t to a civil and not an
<lb/>ecclesiastical government; the Pope,dethroned, declaims to the city and the world
<lb/>that he is a prisoner in his OTjn palace of the Vatican. And since that tyrant of
<lb/>pride I mentioned is inexorbale, the Pope now tells the whole worldthat his
<lb/>Vatican gardens are enough for him to walk about in.
<lb/>The iaarbarous massacres of Jews for racial and religious rivalries have returned
<lb/>in Russia, and when reading in the papers of the gRussian ferocity for extermi
<lb/>nating Jews, I have recalled that the seers of Israel foresaw those massacres
<pb n="37" facs="#page-036"/>
<lb/>many centuries before the coining of the Messiah, and they were foreseen again
<lb/>after Calvary by the last of the prophets, John of Patmos. These mass murders,
<lb/>perpetrated by the genie of sect, under cover of ignorance and greed, cannot be
<lb/>avoided by diplomacy, by the cannons of the great powers nor by the irLgor of
<lb/>the autocracy. The only remedy that will spare humanity from the spectacle of
<lb/>this remnant of barbarism is schools. When Russia in all its vastness is pro
<lb/>vided with schools like those of the United Spates, then all the sects will
<lb/>fraternize there.
<lb/>Scientific visitors to the pyramids of Egypt have had much to admire in the
<lb/>advanced degree of civilization of Ancient Egypt, when they consider the mechan
<lb/>ical methods men have had to employ to raise to such heights those immense
<lb/>cubic stones, each weighing many tons. But today, when I walked down Broadway and
<lb/>passed a site where they are beginning to set the foundations of those enormous
<lb/>buildings, rivals of the pyramids, of 20 or 30 storeys, I have had to admire
<lb/>with pride our own civilization, not precisely becaase of the mechanical means
<lb/>used to raise to such great heights the materials of construction, but rather
<lb/>because men of this century make of concrete stones as hard as granite and 2if
<lb/>such dimensions that those of the pyramids could be the granddaughters of these
<lb/>which the Americans use as fotindations of their business houses.
<lb/>Ah, the home I The magic word which man derives from the word of the fire
<lb/>place with wjiich he heats his dwelling; sweet and sacred word -Khich symbolizes,
<lb/>as none other, conjjugal, fraternal, maternal and filial love. Take away a man's
<lb/>home and you have made of him the most unhappy creature on Earth. On the other
<lb/>hand, imagine a man, the most unfortunate, the poorest, the sickest, most
<lb/>idiotic or criminal, and give him a home, a roof which shields him, amother
<lb/>who blesses him, a child who charms him, and he will think himself more than a
<lb/>king, and would not change his fate for that of a king. The home is but the
<lb/>S3ntibolic paradise the bible speaks of.
<lb/>As I was contemplating today a pretty young lady who was sitting alone on
<lb/>one of the double seats on t he train, in front of me, whose carefree attitude and
<lb/>slightly unkempt hainim and abundant blonde hair, and whose fatigue was sd invincible
<lb/>that it was not at all affedted by the strident noises and shaking of the train,
<lb/>all this made one suppose with reason that her nervous system^had worn out the
<lb/>childish emotions of pleasure, there came to ray memory Christ s profound phrase:
<lb/>"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone',' And in fact, "only Jesus, that
<lb/>divine spirit &gt;dio had aL ready reached the limit of his moral evolution and found
<lb/>himself above the powerful inpulses of the flesh, could have written that defying
<lb/>sentehce in the sand, sure that amidst the accusers if VnA historic woman
<lb/>there would not be any who would throw the stone, starting with the oldest suffer
<lb/>ers of the ills of physical love, (This one doesn't make sense in Spanish either-Ed.)
<lb/>Every man, in his mature age, says to himself: "Oh, if it were granted me to
<lb/>go back to my childhood but with the expeii.ence I have now, how much good could I
<lb/>do and how much evil avoid 1" Well, experience is beneficial to the mature man because
<pb n="38" facs="#page-037"/>
<lb/>of the sum total of practical knowledge he has accjiired in the long years of his
<lb/>life. Do pou want to educate mature children to do all the possible good they
<lb/>can for society and avoid all the evil they can? Well, just put back into the
<lb/>systems of public education the experience of the mature man, giving the child
<lb/>the greatest amount of practical knowledge for life's eventualities. Leave to
<lb/>one side the purely speculative methods, the theories, and base education on
<lb/>fscts, and withput realizing it you will have solved the difficult social problem.
<lb/>I think I've already said this in another "shaving"; what defines genius is
<lb/>to be able to see clearly with the intelligence that which for the mass of mortals
<lb/>A genius is creative becaise he is inspired, that is, because he has the uncon
<lb/>scious cooperation of invisible intelligences. Almost all the great men of genius
<lb/>have been very concentrating kinds of people, and have shown in their characters
<lb/>and their habits something which reveals the medium, that is, the human being
<lb/>who serves as an appropriate organ for communication with the invisible world
<lb/>which surrounds us. These thoughts occurred to me as Itos contentedly listening
<lb/>to arias by Patti and Caruso on a friend's phonograph, I couldn't decide what
<lb/>to admire more, the musical genius of the singers or the inventor who created
<lb/>this marvelous mechanism which catches, fixes and reproduces so much harmony.
<lb/>In the end I chose the la i^er, and I admired Edison even more for having enriched
<lb/>the human commonwealth with the electric products if his genius.
<lb/>Do you wonder why the IMited States is the country of millionaires, as no
<lb/>other country has been ever before? It is because New York has a great school
<lb/>of finance, free and open air. If you go between 11 A.M, and 3 P.M. to the first
<lb/>block of Broad Street, you'll find yourself suddenly amidst a whirlwind of
<lb/>businessmen on a vast scale. If you are observants, you will see there everything
<lb/>from the boy of lU, whinhas just graduated from public school, to the man of
<lb/>seventy who has grown old in business, amidst a confusion and shouting incom
<lb/>prehensible for the profane ean*, carrying out transactions of hundreds of thousands
<lb/>and even millions of dollars. This most original school, a branch of the great
<lb/>stock exchanges of New York and Europe, graduates every day in mid-street finan
<lb/>ciers a la Morgan, Eockefeller and Carnegie, But if you don't Tinder stand the
<lb/>jargon of the business, faaisaHSEPQ take care not to get involved with any of those
<lb/>hawks, for they will pluck you nude in a trice. If you want to transact some legi
<lb/>timate business, look for an binest businessman, and there are some, but hard to find.
<lb/>In great cities with millions of inhabitants, there are great parks, well
<lb/>laid out, kept up and maintained, like Prospect Park in Brooklyn, wherein would
<lb/>fit easily one of our sm^er cities of Latin America. These extensive parks are
<lb/>efficient collaborators of the Socialists, but of the philosophical Socialists
<lb/>like Henry George, Bellamy and Pinidhon. These parks accustom people to the idea
<lb/>of enjoying something of common property, or, better stated, to enjoy the goods
<lb/>of the commanity as a whole. Examining carefully the organization of these parks,
<lb/>where ill can call therBelves owners but none can exercise exclusive and despotic
<lb/>dominion, where order ceigns and everybody can reasonably enjoy the charms of
<lb/>Nature, where public funds are honestly spent to advance a nd beautify the common
<lb/>property, where, finally, advantage is made of the efforts of all for the benefit
<pb n="39" facs="#page-038"/>
<lb/>of each individual, it becomes clear how easy it is to bring about happiness in
<lb/>a general sense when egotism is deposed and greed is murdered.
<lb/>The men of all the Christian sects, even those who rightly oDnsider themselves
<lb/>the most advanced, such as the Christian Scientists, make, to my mind, a very
<lb/>serious mistake in spending enormous sums to build immense and costly structures,
<lb/>the so-caLled tenples dedicated to the Divinity. I have just read that in Boston
<lb/>there has been inaugurated a great cathedral of Ehristian Science,costing two
<lb/>million dollars, as public tasichnHnymfeBKi^ demonstration of the immense propa
<lb/>gation of that faith, which 25 years ago hardly had 26 adherents to the doctrines
<lb/>of Mrs, Mary Eddy but which now has 82,000 members in the country. Would it not
<lb/>have been more s ensible and more Christian to put up a modest building that costs
<lb/>$100,000 for the meetings of the faithful and dedicate the $1,900,000 to works
<lb/>of true philanthropy? When Jesus stopped by the well of Jacob in Samaria, a
<lb/>sijiple woman asked Hira whether it was better to pray to God on the mountain, as
<lb/>her fathers did, or in a tenple, as did the Jews, And Jesus answered her: "Woman,
<lb/>the time approaches when the children of God will not adore Him either on the
<lb/>mountain or in the temple, but in the spirit, and truly',' It would seem, however,
<lb/>that such a time is still delayed by human vanity.
<lb/>That popular phrases and proberbs have a kernel of truth is easily seen,
<lb/>"Greed bursts the sack" is the proverb â vdiichthe American Trusts are putting before
<lb/>the eyes of the nations of the world. The evil systems with which American greed
<lb/>has comipted not only the meat industry in stockyards and industrial centei^
<lb/>but also the morality of the laidaaH group that produces presevred meats, has
<lb/>recently waked the Federal gnvernraent from its lethargy, with the aim of
<lb/>punishing those magnaftes who are turning that corruption into gold. As the
<lb/>world is scandalized by the revelation of the shaneful methods the monopolists
<lb/>have instituted, the American industries will suffera mortal blow, which will
<lb/>force public opinion to cast out the political party which gave rise to this
<lb/>palpable corruption.
<lb/>Among t^ many human aberrations is the legacy. Just as monopoly, abuse,
<lb/>usurpation and despoiling have been given a decent look by being called Property,
<lb/>so too a paternal mistake, exaggerated and blind, has been called legacy. If man
<lb/>has the right to pile up the fruits of his labors, it should be on condition
<lb/>that he enjoy it sensibly using it for the needs of this present life, to
<lb/>easily educate his children; but he has not theright to leave to society his
<lb/>lazy and vice-ridden children, having put in their hands riches, the thing most
<lb/>calculated to harden the feelings and corrup the mores. The State should start by
<lb/>taxing inheidtances heavily, to cause them to be invested in works of education
<lb/>and benefit to the public, and after some time it will havw to abolish them
<lb/>with ease, when in society there is a majority of sensible and moral people who
<lb/>knows how to make good use of money.
<lb/>For the first time in my life I have seen a good ^blio .1^soaiptnous and splendid temple. It is the sniunsr, there's a bright em in the sky

<lb/>and the teiT5)erature is 95Â°Fahrenheit at one o'clock, the hoirr at â which the working
<lb/>people of New York leaves â their desks and offices and goes in search of lunch. And
<lb/>today they have had the good sense to open the side doors of Trinity Church at
<lb/>Broad-way and Wall Street, -with-dae saintly and conpassionate aim of allowing the
<lb/>tired passers-by, who are all making their li-vings, to rest for some moments be
<lb/>neath the lofty vaults og the chuivdi, which still hold cool air. I took up the
<lb/>invi-tation and, seatdd on one of the comfortable benches, I started to set do-wn
<lb/>these lines, raising mentally my most fervent thanks to the Supreme Being, since
<lb/>sectarian intransigeance has given-vsy to peaceful reflection and has signed a
<lb/>peace treaty with modern civilization, permitting that one of its oldest tenples
<lb/>serve for the prayers most pleasing to God, that is, -fche peaceful rest after
<lb/>work and eating, surrounded by silence and fi^sh air.
<lb/>Today in Battery Park I saw a wonan kiss her three year old daughter with
<lb/>such effusi-ve tenderness that it made me feel the base of kindness in the human
<lb/>heart and has suggested some reflections about human evolution. There -will come a
<lb/>time in -which the mjority of humanity -will ha-ve purified their fluids by means
<lb/>of numerous reincarnations and -will hawe becone receptive to the beneficial
<lb/>influences of elevated spirits. Then humanity -will have entered into that period
<lb/>predicted bji the prophets of oH and called by them the Millennium. The base
<lb/>passions engendered by carnal instincts â will have gi-vsn -way to the noble passions
<lb/>that come from the Spirit. Hatred, -vengeancw, greed, jealousy will have been
<lb/>rep]a ced by kaimbuasa gentleness, humility, iinselfishness, abnegation and gene
<lb/>rosity .love will be the common link among men, as it is be-tween a mother and
<lb/>her children. War will be lost in history as some sort of horrible nigh-tanare,
<lb/>and the immense sums spent in the -waging of war -will be applied to works of
<lb/>general wellbeing and beautification of the planet. But that glorious time can
<lb/>only come slowly, in proportion to the education and moralization of man.
<lb/>Religion and politics, in the defini-tion given to them by the professionsla
<lb/>of these two lucrative industries, are twin sisters of great likeness. Both have
<lb/>as their basis a personal interest, one the sect and the other the party; both are
<lb/>based on strength and -violently enforced; both have been engendered iijjDdiiaiirmd
<lb/>and nourished by hatred and vengeance against rival sects and parties. Both have
<lb/>been mothers, one of superstition and the other of ignorance; both have killed
<lb/>the freedom of the people; both, nourished by hypocirsy, have usurped the righ-fcs
<lb/>of the people, both have created monopolies and enriched their followers; both
<lb/>have allied themsel-ves intimately to cause the crudest and most devastating
<lb/>wars; both, finally, have been and are a true calamity for hTunanity, for they
<lb/>have been and are anrBsamxa obstinate remora for the progress and happiness of
<lb/>the world. I speak of religion and politics in terms of the false concept people
<lb/>have of them and the worst application made of them.
<lb/>The facade of the Church of La Goitpania in Quito, the Jesuit temple, has been
<lb/>held to be an admirable stone mon-ument of the 17th century. In fact, there you can
<lb/>admire not only the perfection of the figures of saints and the details worked
<lb/>upon the granite by Indian IxhEKECx craftsmen, but also its beauty as a work of
<lb/>architecture. It would be interesting to conpare the long years which that
<lb/>work took, in the time when tools were limited to little more than the hand of
<lb/>man armed with a rough chisel a nd a crude hammer, snd the current age in which
<pb n="41" facs="#page-040"/>
<lb/>lio M
<lb/>I have seen rise up, in a few short months, buildings of 30 storeys, taller
<lb/>than a cathedral tower, whose facades, made of rough stone, have been majnrellously
<lb/>worked ib a few days by talented hands which deftly operate electric chisels.
<lb/>Looking at these seemingly unbelievable works, I have recalled the well-known
<lb/>phrase of Pelletan: "The world marches on'.', and I have asked ryself with wonder
<lb/>what might be the possibilities of these Americans within four centuries. The
<lb/>answer has beai given to me by Edward Bellamy in his book "Looking backward'.'
<lb/>According to the ancients. Earth, Air, Fire and Water were the four elelemnts
<lb/>of the universe upon which all life and all occurrences depended. But today the
<lb/>modems have discovered, thanks to the progress of science, that these four jdusiimKila
<lb/>things are but the greab witiwitiwnw elements of hygiene, the ill use made of which
<lb/>becomes the cause of human illnesses. Civilization, which is but the progress of
<lb/>human evolution, has produced great benefits, but has also brought along great
<lb/>evils, and among these latter are the bad uses we make of these ele&amp;ents. The
<lb/>lower animals and the savages have no knowledge of illness because they are close
<lb/>to Nature. Of the products of the Earth we prefer, as nourishment, meats, which
<lb/>stimulate the production of uric acid in the blood. To pure and naturalâ Kater we
<lb/>prefer that which is mixed with poisonsnand which we call liquor. We knowingly
<lb/>and on purpose change the air with a thousabd different scents, notions and
<lb/>noxious powders and impede its free access to our bedrooms. We do the same with
<lb/>light and the heat of the sun, and wre have changed night into day by depraved
<lb/>habits, depriving ourselves of the xamAing sleep which mends and replaces the
<lb/>strength lost by work. Yet we commit the in;5ustice of conplaining about Nattire,
<lb/>calling her an evil stepmother, "vdien we ourselves have caused our ills.
<lb/>I have just read that the Pope, with special deference to the nations of
<lb/>America, is vacillating between giving the cardinal's cap to some prelate of the
<lb/>United States or of the Republic of Argentina, the two powers at either end of
<lb/>the continent, and at the same time he makes Italian cardinals by the dozens
<lb/>to insure an Italian majority for the election of the Popes, and the whole
<lb/>business stays in the family. But I am not really surprised by this procedure
<lb/>inspired by exclusively nationalistic and sectarian interest; what does surprise
<lb/>me is that this persiflage should be given a religious character. What, in reality,
<lb/>does this self-interested game of hign world diplomacy have to do with the sublime
<lb/>practical teachings of humility, abnegation and maternal love iirparted by Jesus?
<lb/>Of course, nothing at all, for we d 1 know that since CJiristianity ascended the
<lb/>throne of Enperors and Kings it ceased to be Christianity and became Popery,
<lb/>While going through the immense steel works of South Bet^hem (pa.),
<lb/>reputed to be the largest in the world, I couldn't decide whether to admire
<lb/>the mechanical genius of the Americans, or to be afstoimded by the senselessness
<lb/>of men, who still spend their energies fabricating great cannons of 12 inches
<lb/>barrel diametens to blow themselves to bits; and, caught between those two
<lb/>feelings, one of horror for the murders, a nd one of admiration for the inventions,
<lb/>I opted for the latter. I thought that what we call evil is a transitory phenomenon
<lb/>which exists only becaise of man s ignorance, but which will soon cease to be.
<pb n="42" facs="#page-041"/>
<lb/>vhen man's intelligence has been illximined and his conscience emancipated.
<lb/>Then all that steel which, melted in plutonic furnaces, has run into molds to
<lb/>come out in the shape of fearful firearms, will run into other molds to emerge
<lb/>in the form of artifacts appropiaate for making life comfortable and sweet,
<lb/>converting this backwards planet in a true paradise. Evil is essentially
<lb/>transitory; only good is eternal.
<lb/>It is a comforting affiiroation of modern science that music has a double
<lb/>and diubly efficient influence on man, curative and educational; it remedies
<lb/>atavistic vices by sweetening the feelings and destroying malevolent tendencies,
<lb/>preparing thusly the healthy man of the future. For that reason nowadays the
<lb/>governments which are truly interested in the progress of their peoples are
<lb/>creating attractive music centers for the working classes; and private concerns
<lb/>are pixjpagating classical music, which purifies the fluids by meansof melody.
<lb/>As I passes by the door of one of the many old-folks' homes in Brooklyn,
<lb/>I saw a venerable group of eight or ten white heads peaceful3y conversing in
<lb/>the shade in the xh trees in this summer season, I thought to myself that only
<lb/>God has the privelege of reading those white pages which fill me with respect.
<lb/>How many vicissitudes, how many feaxx mistakes, how many right choices, how much
<lb/>e3q3erience has whitened those heads with the passing of the years? 'Whatever
<lb/>might have been the espffiriences "vdiich have left their mark upon the consciousness
<lb/>of those men, they are the advanced students in the school of life. From the
<lb/>moment when these men got together in this home set up by the sentiment of
<lb/>human fraternity (?), it is becanse theji carry in themselves, like wounded
<lb/>veterans that the State takes care of in its barracks, the glorious scars
<lb/>which they received in the bloody battle of life on this planet. That is why
<lb/>old people are worthy of and given respect by the young.
<lb/>JULY
<lb/>History doesnot tell how many years it took the Egyptians to build their
<lb/>pyramids, nor that they were but tombs for their kings, but Napoleon had the
<lb/>glory of perpetuating his nanÂ® tellingnhis soldiers that forty centuries
<lb/>were wab ching them from their summits, in the business they were about to xmder-
<lb/>take of enslaving a race. Well, without being a NapeSieon, any American of today
<lb/>can fill himself with glory haranguing in such a manner the thoudands of passersby
<lb/>who daily walk down Broadway; "Fellow citizens; forty weeks contemplate you from
<lb/>the windows of that 30th floor, which you have rased up so that your men can have
<lb/>the most a ctive life ever seen by the Â£ges, and tdiere you are piling up the
<lb/>fabulous riches of this young nation, which is the admiration of the world,
<lb/>which it will soon dominAe with the power of its business and its industries,
<lb/>as long as you set up reasonable limits to the greed of the trusts'.' Truly, there
<lb/>is more glory attached to the building of one cf these temples of business and
<lb/>industry in ten months than in a tomb thdt takes a quarter century.
<lb/>A siitple reading of the account in the European newspapers of the most recent
<pb n="43" facs="#page-042"/>
<lb/>maneuvers to simulate a naval war has given me enough thoughts to measure,
<lb/>insofar as possible, the level mankind has readhed in its evolution towards
<lb/>progress. It cannot be denied that human progress in the intellectual and material
<lb/>spheres has not been so great. Taking the imagination from the rough balsa-wood
<lb/>boats of primitive man with his cruel hand to hand combats, wherein the vicjror
<lb/>celebrated his victory with an open air banquet on the flesh of the conquered,
<lb/>to the splendid and powerful wgrships of 18 tons displacemtne and 23 knots
<lb/>speed, with cannons of 12 inches diameter and hellish projectile sxsntiiiiiHiriilua
<lb/>faHdy below, there is no doubt that men have acheived an immense progress.
<lb/>But in the moral sphere?..,It is certainly horrifying to consider the disastrous
<lb/>effects of the senseless collisions of the bastard ambitions of the governors
<lb/>of nations. We daily see brotherhood and justice, the virtues which genert e
<lb/>morality, outraged more and more in the great world. That is whjr there is still
<lb/>tenacious opposition to the aspirations of certain generous souls who have pro
<lb/>posed general disarmament, with the aim of avoiding barbarous wars, and freeing
<lb/>the people from the onerous taxes needed to maintain standing armies.
<lb/>I have seen a fanous picture which has iii5)reEsed me favorably. It shows the
<lb/>moment in which John Brown, that first and noble victim in t he great war to abo
<lb/>lish slavery, was taken from his prison to be shot. As John Brown descended the
<lb/>stairs, several black women, whose husbands were perhaps escaped ^aves, held up
<lb/>their children so he could kiss them, that is, so he could annoint them with the
<lb/>holy oil of brotherly love. This has brou^t to my mind the matter of races.
<lb/>It is without doubt that the prigin of the human species was multiple. Those of
<lb/>us who accept the laws of evolution have no difficulty accepting thsit man cair^
<lb/>from an anthi^oidal primate, and this evolution could have taken place several
<lb/>places on the various continents of this world, and the first representatives
<lb/>of humanity had to suffer all the vicissitudes of the environment in order to
<lb/>set the characteristic features which mark him to this day. If it is a clear fact
<lb/>that the fair Caucasian race is the most advanced in its physical evolution,
<lb/>that whiteness of the skin, that golden hair, that heavenly blue of the eyes
<lb/>should ne harmonized with the sublime sentiments of the spirit so that its progress
<lb/>in secure and effective. The physical pasac part of man is perishablej it's here
<lb/>today and gone tomorrow. The spirit is aLl that survives and it goes on progressing
<lb/>indefinitely: if today it has been reincarnated in the white person, tomorrow, that
<lb/>is, in the next reincarnation, it could enliven a black body, with kinky hair and
<lb/>thick lips, aid it could feel the same dislike that it had for blacks when it was
<lb/>white. So then, reason and justice are in favor of theequality of the races
<lb/>by means of generous sentiments and noble virtues.
<lb/>Today, July ijth, the sun having barely risen, I already hear the thunderous
<lb/>detonations of the firecrackers and petards with which the vigorous American
<lb/>people celebrates the day of its independence from England's dominationj I should
<lb/>like, as a tribute to the generous hospitality of this cosmopolitan and happy
<lb/>nation, to dedicate to it the finest, prettiest and most elegant shaving I could
<lb/>plane from my brain, but I have to limit myself to a single, modest and ingenuous
<lb/>sampling of my admiration. In all human history no nation has acheived in 30 years
<lb/>of self-government the colossal jtegnmaxiirf heights of the United States, The
<lb/>nations of Europe, which count several dozen centuries of existence, have not
<lb/>attained the astonishing vitality and social development of this country. Here I
<pb n="44" facs="#page-043"/>
<lb/>vould have need of the elegant language of Statistics to support my point, but Â±H
<lb/>to no avail would I pile up figures and more figures to pirove that which is evi
<lb/>dent to the whole world. In fireworks alone it is estimated that today 10 million
<lb/>dollars will go up in smoke, a sum which would easily supply the budgets of two
<lb/>of our little Latin American republics, But you will tell me I'm making too much
<lb/>of the material advancement, while Europe is in the avantguard of the intellec
<lb/>tual and moral sjiheres. Nonsense, Intellectual development is shown in its two
<lb/>greatest maiifestations: education and the press, and this country by itself has
<lb/>more s chools and newspapers than all the countries of Europe put t ogether. This
<lb/>is proved by its 33,000 nevrspapers. In the moral sphere, charity is its fundamental
<lb/>base, in the United States there are more hospijsals and asymlums of all types
<lb/>than perhaps in all Europe, In America beggars are unknown and the worker gets
<lb/>more justice than in Europe, which is why the latter is being depopulated and
<lb/>the former filling up.
<lb/>While I was walking through the maginficent New York Aquarium, the great
<lb/>variety of colorful fish and their abundant reproduction in ad hoc breeding
<lb/>areas made me think of the profound philosophy one derives from Darwin's
<lb/>scientific theory. Is it possible, I asked myself, that such a great variety
<lb/>of shapes, colors, forms andorganic dispositions, ail so different and all so
<lb/>admirably adapted to every type of lifestyle in the immense bosom of the seas,
<lb/>is it possible that it all had one sole origin, that inysterious and incompre
<lb/>hensible protoplasm that covered the surface of the waters and which carried
<lb/>within itself that latent life that would develop over the centuries into the
<lb/>infinite animal and vegetable species that enhance the earthly universe? Moved,
<lb/>Isaid wity emotion: "Oh Father of the Universe, if through only the action of
<lb/>Thy will all creation could have developed from that almost invisible seed called
<lb/>protoplasm into the intelligent and free man of the 20fch century, I wish my
<lb/>veneration for the greatness of Thy actions and Thy handiwork could have no
<lb/>limits, I see Thee greater in making all beings evolve from one seed, than in
<lb/>creating new ones atÂ®ch moment.
<lb/>To hope that egotism, that is, self-interest, could disappear from today's
<lb/>society is the same as to tiy t o stifle the se3eual instinct in youth once it has
<lb/>awakened. Neither is evil if it is directed well. Without egotism the world
<lb/>would not have advanced; it has made heroes both in peace and war by the wish of
<lb/>personal glory; it has also made martyrs by that vehement expression of indi
<lb/>vidual perfection. Direct egotism so that it seeks its own interests in the general
<lb/>good and you will have cased humanity to advance. Similarly, direct reasonably
<lb/>the sexual tirge in youth, preferring the interests and inprovement of the stock
<lb/>to the mere individual pleasure, and you will have killed at one stroke many
<lb/>vices. This you can acheive by instructing the youth with careful frankness
<lb/>about the august function of sex. It is time, both in the home and in the school,
<lb/>for that fear of speaking to children a nd young people about matters of vital
<lb/>inpoirtance to sexuality to disappear. Love and ambition are not evils when they
<lb/>are noble and proper.
<lb/>Last night I went to the opera to hear Faust, aid here a re the ideas
<pb n="45" facs="#page-044"/>
<lb/>that crossed ray mind during its various scenes. There is no doubt, I thought,
<lb/>that the theater is a school of customs, as the illxistrious Ecuadorean poet
<lb/>Olmedo said, vhich has contributed to moralize the public, and for that reason
<lb/>the clergy has been its greatest eneny. All the dramatists, from the great
<lb/>Shakespeare, glory of England, to Don Jose de Echegaray, the current glory of
<lb/>Spain, have tried to praise the noble passions and cause the ignoble and base
<lb/>ones to be hated. There is also no doubt that this seductive means of civilizing,
<lb/>in order to be on a level with modein thought, needs, like the novel,
<lb/>and new evolution which elevates and does not depress the characters. Love, the
<lb/>mother of d.1 passions, the universal passion, the axle on which theater aid novel
<lb/>revolve, to worthily dducate the public should abandon the personal, sensual and
<lb/>egotistical forms and adopt those nobler ones of altruism, abnegation, sacrifice,
<lb/>philanthropy, universal brotherhood. The theater, if it would attract the higher
<lb/>and thinking clauses, should abandon the trivial, the "cutesyy the crude and
<lb/>repulsive slapstick things which repel the delicate. All that is noble, worthy,
<lb/>inspirational and elevated should be its arsenal, its stock in trade, as the
<lb/>English have it. Otherwise, it will suffer the same fate as the churches,
<lb/>which are steadily eii?)tying.
<lb/>Today I have had reason to d eplore the slow progress of medicine. I find
<lb/>a noteworthy parallelism between this science which would cure the body, and
<lb/>religion, which asserts with erphasis that it cures the soul. For twenty centu
<lb/>ries both have been walking along in the shadovrs, because forgetting the things
<lb/>of the spirit, they have been more preoccupied with things of the body and the
<lb/>material Ì here. But it must be said that this march has been in time xd.th the
<lb/>development of humanity. Today the proportion of those who admit or put into
<lb/>practice the curative action of the fluids or ethereal forces in the univeiue
<lb/>is in the same illation as those who have laid aside the religion which is mere
<lb/>formulas or ceremonies, to direct themselves according to the dictates of a
<lb/>healthy moral sense, whose has is brotherly love. Every day mankind approaches more
<lb/>closely the time when it will suppress and avaaid sicknesses because it will have
<lb/>ordered its habits in strict accordance with natural law. Then its religion will
<lb/>consist in the single adoration of the god of natiire in spirit and reality. But
<lb/>today we still need pharmacies, poisons and scalpels to destroy those tissues.
<lb/>I have had the pleasure of meeting and dealing with a sweet, modest and
<lb/>intelligent young lady. She was coming f rom her office, where she works from 8 AM
<lb/>until 5 PM in the delicate affairs of secretary work. Her dress is sirtple, her
<lb/>hat has no feathers, flowers or veils; her pretty hands are bare and she wears
<lb/>no rings, earrings or necklace; her only adornment is a watch which she wears
<lb/>gracefully attached to her breast with a silken cord. From the look and hang of
<lb/>her elegant blouse it was clear that no corset oppressed her waist, and I noticed
<lb/>that her pretty shoes had wide and low heels. Her manner charmed me. She reasoned
<lb/>with clarity and her judgments were sharp and just. She showed a taste refined
<lb/>by the fine arts, I found that she was familiar with histoiy and she was not
<lb/>ignorant of classical literature, I wanted to know of her religious ideas and
<lb/>I artfully led the conversation towards churches and i when I asked her which one
<lb/>she attended on Sundays, with a friendly smile she answered "The same one you
<lb/>frequent, for I have seen you there several times: Prospect Park; in it I say
<lb/>my morning prayers and I thank God who lets us enjoy children, birds and flowers.
<lb/>Then our travelling together ended and I said goodbye, and as I left, moved,
<lb/>I said to iryself that without doubt the cultivation and elevation of the character
<lb/>is the true religion.
<pb n="46" facs="#page-045"/>
<lb/>An elegant man and woman were walking yesterday through the rose garden In
<lb/>Prospect Park, and after walking along the perfumed paths, they sat down on one
<lb/>of the benches where they conversed happily filling the garden with their
<lb/>sonorous laughter. There then appeared a badly dressed old man, whose appearance
<lb/>shewed the ravages of hunger and poverty, and he said something in a low voice to
<lb/>the gentleman, who told him to continue on his way, and the old man did so.
<lb/>Ah, I exclaimed, here is the proof that the most terrible trial for the spirit
<lb/>that is encarnated on this planet is wealth; almost always that person succumbs
<lb/>to it and makes his existence conpletely sterile. Wealth is usually as inclement
<lb/>as winter, for the seductive charms ijith which it fascinates have the power to
<lb/>make its victims insensible. I real]^^ feel conpassion for pitiless rich people
<lb/>at the moment of their awakening on the other side of the tomb, whither they have
<lb/>taken no other luggage than their actions. There they will be transformed into
<lb/>their own terrible border guards, who do not permit the least contraband. There
<lb/>they will shake off their rags one by one and they will be horrible and repugnant
<lb/>to the sight. There will be the cries and gnashing of teeth the Gospel spedcs of.
<lb/>I was watching on a meadow of the park a small group of sheep, whei^some
<lb/>grazed the green and abundant grass without raising the eyes, "tdiile the others,
<lb/>after having filled their first stomach, remained lying down ina tranquil
<lb/>state chewing their cud, watched from a distance by an old shepherd who watched
<lb/>them accompanied by his three dogs. This picturesque and peaceful scene called
<lb/>forth my reflexion and the evolutionary law of beings. What notable differences
<lb/>was I ablÂ® to perceive at that moment among the animals which formed the group i
<lb/>Leaving aside the organic differences and only considering the intellectual and
<lb/>moral ones, there is cause to admire the great distances among those animals,
<lb/>the dogs, the shepherd and me. That the higher animals think and wish is now
<lb/>axiomatic in philosophy, but the way they are so is a matter for study for
<lb/>the scientist and the philosopher. The s eep, the dog and man think and wish
<lb/>according to the development of their organic parts and the spiritual principles
<lb/>idiich inform them all. The dieep who peacefully chews its food is perhaps thinking
<lb/>about just that and beguns to feel affection for its children. The dog now advan
<lb/>ces to interpret and obey its master's commands. The shepherd, in addition to
<lb/>the gift of thought, has attained the consciousness of his own actions. And,
<lb/>without outraging modesty, I think I have gone a step beyond that shepherd because
<lb/>I felt the duty of writing these "shavings" down, becaise of the vibrant desire
<lb/>to be useful to my fellows.
<lb/>While I was aboard a ship ssying goodbye to a family who was leaving for
<lb/>Europe, I was present at an interesting scene. Two men, strong, athletic,
<lb/>with great full beards, apparently Russians, embraced. One of them, perhaps
<lb/>35 years old, who was staying in New York, had his eyes clouded by tears.
<lb/>The other, perhaps Ito years old, had let the fpuntain of feeling run free,
<lb/>bringing tears to the eyes of this your writer. I thought that such tears confirmed
<lb/>that the two men were Russians and brothers; the older one already feels what he
<lb/>is going to suffer in his homeland Tfitnessing the supreme efforts at liberty
<lb/>made by a people puiqDosely held in ignorance a nd superstition. Perpahs he is
<lb/>going already resolved to take an active part in that heroic struggle, pei^ps too
<lb/>he has sworn before the statue of Lincoln to be fPee or perish, and the doubt
<lb/>fulness of success opened the above mentioned fountain when he embraced his
<lb/>brother. The other, filled perhaps with with absolute confidence in the decisions
<pb n="47" facs="#page-046"/>
<lb/>of the future, and feeling himself secure in the bosori of a rich and free people,
<lb/>is pained at the uncertainties of his brother and comforts him and cheers him on
<lb/>to struggle for liberty and life. But in the midst of it all, I thou^t, these
<lb/>two men love eachother, no matter what fate the future holds for either of them,
<lb/>and they will continue to be united by that eternal bond. Ah, blessed in love.
<lb/>Political corruption in horrible union with the sectarian corruption has
<lb/>sacrificed a victom before the eyes of all the civilized Christian nations of the
<lb/>19th century. The Second Err^jire had connipted the mores of noble France, to the
<lb/>extent of dragging her to the disastrous defeat at Sedan, and Tdien the Second
<lb/>Republic arose from the rmins and ashes left by the Paris Commune, the baptism of
<lb/>that Republic was the most scandalous act of injustice that modern mankind has
<lb/>witnessed. The church put itself behind the army to cause the downfall of a Jewish
<lb/>captain, and Dreyfusswas condemned to political and civil death amidst the
<lb/>moral anguish of his family. The years passed ftnd the Republic rose up youthful
<lb/>and made vigorous by the efforts of the healthy and robustpersonalities who
<lb/>had stayed afloat on sll that decay. And now, at the age of 36 years, crowned
<lb/>before the eyes of the world with the shining halo of justice, it dissipates the
<lb/>baleful shadows of the past by separating the church from the state, amending
<lb/>thusly the crime of habing condemned an innocent man, so that the statement of
<lb/>the Scid-ptiires can be made true, ie that evil vannot be eternal.
<lb/>On one of the aLeys of the park there appeared a man and a woman decently
<lb/>dressed, she in strict summer style, all in white, even the parasol, the gentleman
<lb/>in a black jacket, white vest, hi^ hat and a gold-headed cane. From afar I saw
<lb/>that they were speaking excitedly and that their expressions were strained,
<lb/>hers markedly displeased. As I passed they fell silent, but tiieir faces cried out
<lb/>that a terrible,moral storm was unleashed between these two humans. I thought.
<lb/>Marriage, there s a fertile theme for a moralizing preacher, but too vast and
<lb/>difficult to elaborate into a reasonable "shaving" in such a short space, What
<lb/>is the staring cause and effect that tuens a marriage into true hells with such
<lb/>frequency? In my view it is none other t han the insufficient degree of progress
<lb/>of the moral development of the human species. It is not true love which unites
<lb/>two hearts to form the basis of the family; it is social conventions, misguided
<lb/>passions. Educate the young of both sexes scientifically, so that they conpre-
<lb/>hend the august florantniBiJi physiological function of marriage, remove them from the
<lb/>tutelage of the church, always attempt to raise and educate the character, and
<lb/>the hell of today will become the paradise of tomorrow.
<lb/>There is no country in the xrorld which makes such an extraordinary use of
<lb/>the mental suggestion known as advertising as the American, if we take as
<lb/>suggestion the impositionof one will upon another. It is the true home of the
<lb/>ad, which is why it sells more than ary other nation and it imposes itself
<lb/>upon the commerce of the x^orld. The American devotes perhaps half his income to
<lb/>advertising and has sharpened his wit with an eye to making it ever more effective,
<lb/>The greatest commercial problem of the American is to call attention to his
<lb/>products, cost what it may, because he knows by instinct and business experience
<pb n="48" facs="#page-047"/>
<lb/>that his success lies in attracting the attention of the public, for he "will sell
<lb/>more thusly. In the United States social life in all its form is done by advertising.
<lb/>Journalism, so advanced in this country, has received admirable inpetus from
<lb/>advertising. The American is a specialist in the art of advertising. If you cast
<lb/>a bird's-eye glance over New York, you think yourself before an immense page of
<lb/>newspaper ads; roofs, walls, columns, entraceways and even men are covered with
<lb/>ingenious advertising pictures. The sandwich man is a purely American invention;
<lb/>it is a poor man, old and shabby, who instead of panhandling is paid a small sum
<lb/>to carry advertising. So even charity is done by the American through advertising.
<lb/>Since the patient works of the wise Darwin were published, the doctrine of
<lb/>evolution has been generally accepted and the idea of natural selection has
<lb/>everywhere many adherents. This writer is among them, and while silently medi-
<lb/>tarf&gt;ing on the social convenience of the selection of the human species, I
<lb/>have been pleased tos ee that there is such a trend in the United States, Writers,
<lb/>industrialists, moralists, philosophers, politicians, philanthropists, etc.,
<lb/>have hinted at the healthy idea, and even taken some steps towards the goal of
<lb/>setting up special communes, selecting the appropriate site and even advancing
<lb/>funds to set such communes up. But, in my view, if one desires to forma model
<lb/>city which enjiys the charms of the country, as well as all the modern comforts,
<lb/>the initiatorsoof the great plan should begin with a program or arrangement that
<lb/>has been well thought out, so as not t o admit into the commune (which I would
<lb/>call "Selection City") anything but members who possess the highest physical,
<lb/>intelUfi ctuaL and moral attributes, to guarantee the happiness and progress of the
<lb/>commune. All these presumed members shouli tindergo a rigorous medical examination
<lb/>and thusly guarantee the commune freedom from any germs or catching condition,
<lb/>and a moral e xamination through referraals above suspicion, to avoid any atavism
<lb/>or bad moral tendencies.
<lb/>Passing today by St Teresa's church in Brooklyn, I heard the bells sounding
<lb/>that hymn which is played inalmost all American chxirches; and I thought, filled
<lb/>with pleasure, blessed be progress. We have arrived at a period which I would call
<lb/>the evolution of the bells. The prigin of bells is lost in the darkness of
<lb/>history, but during the time of Christianity their use, analyzed in the light of
<lb/>modern science, has bean limited to being a suggestive influence to irpose
<lb/>and peipetuate beliefs. All the sects into which Christianity broke into made
<lb/>use of bells as advocates of creede and ceremonies, as accomplices of their
<lb/>intransigeant impositions and not infrequently as scandalous promoters of their
<lb/>revolutions against the civil authorities. But if they convoked or provoked, they
<lb/>did it always in an unpleasant way, stunning rather th^n attracting. Novr that people
<lb/>are opening their eyes and distinguishing the truth from the lies and the farces,
<lb/>the belUs are dianging their tactics and appealing to harmony to attract those
<lb/>same people who no longer let themselves be taken in so easily.
<lb/>As my wife told one of our sons, nine years old, the feat done by Jesus in the
<lb/>desert, of feeding five thousand people with four loaves of bread and four fish,
<lb/>the lad, surprised by the feat, beyond his lights, coul3 only say, to express his
<pb n="49" facs="#page-048"/>
<lb/>astonishment, "Mama, that was quite a man'i That's just what I tell myself when
<lb/>I see these Americans put up in a gew months an immense and splendid building of
<lb/>25 storeys, with walls and columns of marble and granite, with l5oo hundred
<lb/>offices provided with all desirable comfoirt, Mien I have seen built, also in a
<lb/>few months, a magnificent subterranean railway, 15 miles long, split into two
<lb/>branches, the work carried out without disturbing in the least degree the daily
<lb/>traffic of a city of four million inhabitants, I had to exclaim to my son;
<lb/>"Those men are quite something*,'
<lb/>There has been signed a peace treaty among Guatemala, EL Salvador and
<lb/>Honduras which has put an end to the disastrous war which was destroying those
<lb/>sister republics. This has been acheived through the generous and humane inter
<lb/>vention of two stronger sisters, Mexico and the United States, who, ft"om a position
<lb/>of neutrality, have mediated the ravahes of that war. This indicates that winds
<lb/>of peace are blowing throughoutihe nations of the world, and that the day is
<lb/>not far when a healthy conviction will open the eyes of the people, so that
<lb/>to the regions of power there are carried men free from the dastardly ambitions
<lb/>that give rise to wars. While in America the example has been given of ceding to
<lb/>the irpulses of reason, and international congresses seek ways to live in peace
<lb/>and harmony, poor Russia, in Europe, is about to return to the hoivors of civil
<lb/>war provoked by the ancient greed of the aristocracy. It is sad to s ay, but
<lb/>when a woiind has become infected over the centuries, there is no other remedy
<lb/>than to cauterize it.
<lb/>Today, after lunch, aid at the hour of the greatest heat, I went to rest,
<lb/>as is my habit, for a moment under the high vaukts of Trinity Church, and a
<lb/>pretty young lady entered, decently dressed, wearing a pretty hat artistically
<lb/>decorated with peacock feathers. She knelt down on the cushions of the next
<lb/>pew, inclined her pretty forehead upon the railing and stayed in that position
<lb/>about five minutes. Then she sat up, rested her arm on the pew, her white cheek
<lb/>in her hand, and stayed thusly for some time. I thought to nyself: after her
<lb/>prayers, her memories, and what after all is prayer? Just concentration on
<lb/>one's thoughts, which brings with it a protective current for others and for
<lb/>onesself. He who loves, prays; he who works, iaxEs; he who fulfils the laws,
<lb/>prays. The entire life of that young lady-\ prays .is probably one continuous
<lb/>prayer. She is truly happy, J
<lb/>Today I saw on the way a very pretty young lady, lovely American type, and
<lb/>more interesting still because shetas dressed simply but decently. As I contenp-
<lb/>lated fixedly this young lady. The thought escaped me; "There's a danger there','
<lb/>A danger for her, becaise it can bring her vanity with all its consequences,
<lb/>a danger for others because it can become the cause it can be the caise of
<lb/>the explosion of terrible passions in men and disastrous envy in women. In iry
<lb/>view, female beauty, given the current moral state of society, is a trial as
<lb/>dangerous for the human spirit as is wealth. The beautiful woman almost always
<lb/>fails in her moral evolution; both sexes make her the victim of their passions,
<lb/>and she is very lucky if she comes out unharmed in life's struggles, A beautiful
<lb/>and virtuous woman must be as rare in the world as a truly philanthropic rich man;
<lb/>and I say truly because most of the philanthropies we see are exercised at truir^jet
<lb/>blasts, and Jesus has told us that that true philanthropy is its own reward in
<lb/>this world.

<lb/>What a charming scene I saw thismoming in the parkj I felt very happy to
<lb/>see it and I considered my Sunday truly blessed, A pleasant group of orphans
<lb/>appeared near the honeysuckle arbors which are next to the rtffiadow, cared for and
<lb/>guided by their nannies. What solicitude these ladies showed to mike this morning
<lb/>health walk for their charges agreeable, I thanked God for having created these
<lb/>generous aid noble hearts which have these alien children their own, to show
<lb/>them tender and maternal love. This single scene dlowed me to measure the high
<lb/>degree of moral advancement of IxJm current mankind, in the midst of the black
<lb/>background of selfish passions â Rhich fortunately is being dissipated by the brilliant
<lb/>light given off by true charity. And more progress still has been made in this
<lb/>area, I thought, on the far side of the planet, in that country called New Zealand,
<lb/>which is serving as a mirror to civilized nations in the manner of ruling a people
<lb/>doing all possible good for it. There aee no orphans in New Zealandj If a child
<lb/>has no parents the Orphan Society innracbifcHi immediately makes the fact known by
<lb/>newspaper, and right away the Directory receives many cards from homes which are
<lb/>offering themselves to raise the child who has become an orphan; then the Directory
<lb/>selects the home and delivers the child in accordance with the Statutes. The chosen
<lb/>family receives the child and educates it, receiving at the s ame time a small
<lb/>allotment from the gaxaKiniaaiato Directory. What a happy countryJ
<lb/>Yesterday a multimillionaire died, and the newspaper columns are filled with
<lb/>commentaries and judgments of all kinds. But the fact is that the spirit of
<lb/>Russell Sage has gone over to tie other side of the tomb, taking with him only
<lb/>his memories of his 90 years of existence on this planet and the sura of ideas
<lb/>and affections he cultivated during that long life, I have said it before: iioE
<lb/>for the human spirit, accoixiing to the spiritualist doctrine, the trial of wealth
<lb/>is perhaps the most difficult becaise of the fascination it produces amd from
<lb/>which only rarely does one e scape. The wise assertion ofthe philospoher who died
<lb/>on Calvary, thi it is aasier for a cable to pass through the eye of a needle
<lb/>than for a rich man to be saved, that is, that he realize his moral progress,
<lb/>has taken 20 centuries to be finally understood in its true meaning. The
<lb/>abundance of money, either inherited or acquired by working, has the effect of
<lb/>extinguishing the affections th^. raise the spirit. For that reascai Jesus said
<lb/>to a rich young man who said he had kept the Ten Commandments and
<lb/>nowwanted to be His disciple; "Go, sell all you have aid give it to the poor'.'
<lb/>The young manias aad, because he felt he could not make that sacrifice. Poor
<lb/>R -ussell Sage, I have pity for you. By leaving great legacies for public charity,
<lb/>with the best of intentions you have sown the fertile seed of ittplacable hatreds
<lb/>among your heirs, and that will be the cause of grief for your spirit.
<lb/>lA/hen belief systems have lost their efficacy by the adulteration of their
<lb/>tenets, appeal is made to the importance of certain people to galvanize a pres
<lb/>tige which had been lost through errors and bad passions. I constantly see that
<lb/>the Catholic church makes a great deal of the conversion of some prestigious
<lb/>person to the Catholic faith; which in rty opinion constitutes a tacit recog
<lb/>nition that confidence has been lost in the theories propagated as religion.
<lb/>Jesus had multitudes following him more for the effciacy ofHhis deedsthan
<lb/>because of His words, which for the most part were not understood. The convereion
<lb/>of Princess Enna (Probably Queen Ena of Spain..Ed.) and of fxx Countess Cassini
<lb/>to Catholicism has caused applause in the Vatican over this triunph over all
<lb/>the other sects.
<pb n="51" facs="#page-050"/>
<lb/>Amidst the solemn silence which prevailed this afternoon at 1 PM in TiiJiity
<lb/>Church, with the terg^erature at a suffocating 90 Â° F, those of us -tdio had entered
<lb/>the church in search of somewhat cooler air beneath the elevated vaults of that
<lb/>church saw enter a poorly dressed woman, with thdt look which is characteristic
<lb/>of those &gt;310 have lost touch &gt;d.th reason, who started to walk around all the pews
<lb/>speaking in Ì  loud voice as a preacher would. Then the two church guards went over
<lb/>to her, ard the stronger of them took her by the jaaai arm, indicating the door
<lb/>with the other hand, "But who can give me what I seek?" said with noteworthy
<lb/>indignation the madwoman, vhkich indeed she was, and they finally got her out by
<lb/>the side door, I thought that this unhappy woman has mistaken her century and the
<lb/>place wherein she should seek out her rerae&lt;fy. Had she been bom in the time of
<lb/>Jesus or that of the Apostles, she would have been cured of her terrible madness.
<lb/>But it is not nowadays, and much less in a church, where she will be able to
<lb/>find iDsnc that which she seeks, ie her cure, Wiy has there been lost, among those
<lb/>who say they are the continuers of the Apostles, that precious gift of curing
<lb/>illnesses by the laying on of the haids and the sinple exertion of willpower?
<lb/>The answer is quite simple: because it has been many centuries that ths spirit of
<lb/>God has left these vaults.
<lb/>The press announces that for the dance that vas given in the Palace of Justice
<lb/>in Caracas in honor of the first Magistrate of the Republic fifteen thousand
<lb/>pesos â¢were spent just for floxrers; and at the same â¢time it is more â¢than likely
<lb/>that light now in Venezuela there are more than fifteen thousand human beings
<lb/>â¢who are suffering the rigors of hunger and poverty. And this is not the only
<lb/>case of â¢the squandering of money on itens of simple vanity. Every day the news
<lb/>papers of the â¢whole world â¢tell the tale of â the perfectly useless scpenditure of
<lb/>huge sums, destined to flatter the pride and vanity of those who are called the
<lb/>powerful of the Earth, This is a clear proof that human judgment has not yet
<lb/>matured. Far from it, if one thinks of the millions upon millions that are
<lb/>spent throughout the world on things which are harmful to health and morality,
<lb/>such as alcohol, -tea, coffee, opium and other stimulants which undemiine the
<lb/>human body, one must agree that the great Matron which we call Ci^vilization
<lb/>still wears beneath her beautiful robes those rags which she used in the forests.
<lb/>Of all the exploitations of man upon man, none has caused more admiration
<lb/>than Life Insurance, because of the great success of its organiza-bion. The
<lb/>philanthropic economists say that these Insuramce Companies have contributed to
<lb/>foment savings and prudent economyj but I say that what they have contributed to
<lb/>is the fabulous enrichment of themselves, at the cost of the savings and work
<lb/>of all social classes. 99% of â¢the probablilities are in favor of the cirppany,
<lb/>and 1% only in favor of the policyholder. The insured must be healthy , robust,
<lb/>well-built, "With no trace of bad genetics, moderate, of good knahmtwy work habits,
<lb/>to be able to pay annually and on a precise date the premiums â¢which t hey must
<lb/>give the coirpanies just becaase â¢they have been insured as men of a healthy and
<lb/>irreproachable lifestyle. Even given these conditions, if it should occur that
<lb/>he cannot make the premiums on the fatal date, e-verything is lost, except the
<lb/>bitter experience, purchased at the cost of the most innocent lack of foresight.
<lb/>What proves that men have not yet arrived at the age of reason is the fact
<pb n="52" facs="#page-051"/>
<lb/>that they always makw the prosperity and wellbelng of people depend on the
<lb/>perishable life of mortals, rather than on laws and institutions, which are the
<lb/>solid rock upon idiich that futre and that prosperity should rest. Stock-market
<lb/>transactions, \diich regulate the financial march of nations, are too often
<lb/>dependant on the good or bad mood of a monarch upon awaking, perhaps after a
<lb/>night of disqjiation and excesses. Poor humanity, still at the beginning of its
<lb/>peregrination towards a life that is truly free and rationale But in the midst
<lb/>of that illogical march of the more powerful nations, a modest coliny, New
<lb/>Zealand, which can be said to be still in its infancy, is the most eloquent and
<lb/>inspiring example of true government by the people and for the people, for there
<lb/>the happiness of the nation depends on sensible institutions and healthy habits.
<lb/>Mankind, without love, would have had upon the Earth the most unhappy and
<lb/>perhaps most unbearable life. There is no social class, fSrom tlie most Ì Ided
<lb/>palaces to the humblest hut that has mot felt the sharp thorns of pain and
<lb/>suffering. Well, there provident Naturehas put love, the only true balm for all
<lb/>wounds, as the amly sweetener for all bitterness. This love, this universal cure,
<lb/>sexual, conjugal, maternal, filial, including the love of countryand of humanity,
<lb/>affects all possible shapes and foniB, but all these varieties of love are
<lb/>manifestations of God in human nature, because God is infinite love. Therefore
<lb/>Jesus was abletto love men up to his own sacrificdj he prescribed as the only
<lb/>religion to love one another as brothers.
<lb/>On the 8 o'clock train it fell to me to sit between two young ladies, of
<lb/>those who in their tois of thousands travel daily from Brookl^ni to work at
<lb/>desks in offices in New York, Without being a great eopert on f^es, I felt I
<lb/>detected in one of the yoxmg ladies traits, features which are characteristic
<lb/>of a.lively intelligence, and in the other s, those of kindness. And I felt so
<lb/>Bappy that I couldn't help stopping ny reading a magazine and tum my thoughts to
<lb/>the actions of the fluids, or htiman auras, as scientists are calling them nowadays.
<lb/>It is dearthat this wellbeing I feel comes from the auras of these two young
<lb/>ladies. Although I might be mistaken in the idea I have formed of their intellectual
<lb/>and moral traits, I cm see clearly that the fluids of a woman are generally purer
<lb/>than those of a man. That is why women are so attractive and so well stiited to
<lb/>carry in their delicates bosoms the seed of humanity. In the womm and in the
<lb/>mother, wise Nature has especially put love,to insure human life and progress.
<lb/>From there the need to give the mothers of the future an education which will
<lb/>elevate their feelings and multiply their knowledge.
<lb/>As mankind becomes more enlightened, it sees that education and religion are
<lb/>synonymous. Education elevates the sentiments, dignifies the character, elightens
<lb/>the intelligence with self-knowledge and the knowledge of the laws of Nature, to
<lb/>respect and obey them. That s also what Jesus taught about religion, "Keep the
<lb/>law". He responded to a young man who wanted to know the essence of religion,
<lb/>and that law is understood more and more byrmian as he becomes ehlightened, that
<lb/>is as he is educatted; and for this there is no need for rites or ceremonies,
<lb/>Jesus disapproved of outwardshow and hypocrisy, and therefore attracted the hatred
<lb/>of those who called themselves religious men, love, brotherjood, doing good, those
<lb/>were His religion and He told His disciples: "Do this in my memory'.' So then.
<pb n="53" facs="#page-052"/>
<lb/>to be valid and to accoit?)lish its goals, education must inspire in men love,
<lb/>brotherhood and the habit of doing good.
<lb/>AUGUST
<lb/>1
<lb/>The origin of the human species was almost a mysteiy to scientists, until
<lb/>Darwin set down the bases of the theory of evolution. Not so for the theologians,
<lb/>for whom sufficed the biblical legend about t he three sons of Noah, a legend
<lb/>which generied slavery. The glimmerings of evolutionism, which since the time of
<lb/>Aristotle began to cross the intellectual atmosphere of mankind from time to tiirÂ®,
<lb/>finally became a brilliant focus of li^t only with the works of Darwin. The
<lb/>link, believed by scientists to be lost, between anthropoids and man, is the only
<lb/>thing that can BiBazxap esqjlain the diversity of the current human races. In those
<lb/>very anthropoids we can already see the diversity of skin color aid hair, of
<lb/>climactic phenomena, perhaps; butihe spiritual being must have been the same in all
<lb/>races, ever since the moral awareness was set dow n upon it. Xnd since the spi
<lb/>ritual being is the only true and undying thing, it follows from that logically
<lb/>that all men are equal morally.
<lb/>A friend has told me of an octogenarian woman in Canada who is still so
<lb/>healthy and vigorous that she is the marvel of all; aid vAien they asked her
<lb/>the s ecret of her robustness, she replied: "I have been a very careful tenant of
<lb/>my rooms, and the landlord keeps me in them becaise He knows I treat it well".
<lb/>This wise old lady was alluding to her good hygiene and the excellent habits
<lb/>which kept her body hale and hearty. All we human tenants should have the
<lb/>good sense and intelligence of this old Canadian lady to keep not only the
<lb/>house but also the tenant in good condition.
<lb/>A lovely painting of the chaste Susana, work of one of the best artists
<lb/>in Quito, in idiich two old men with expressive faces furtively watched the
<lb/>fair Susana, almost con^Dletely nude on entering her bath, has again brought to
<lb/>my memory the exaggerated scruples of the president of the "Anti-vice League','
<lb/>on the one hand, and on the other the audacious greed of the so-called artists
<lb/>who speculate in coarse pictures of female nudes. It strikes me that each,
<lb/>pseudo-artists and pseudo-moralists, sins in his own way. The world is still in
<lb/>the moral state of the two old men who with ardent curiosity fixed their eyes
<lb/>on the beautiful form of Susanna. To canbine in a single individual artistic
<lb/>beauty and the chaste purity of the sexual in^^ulse. it is first necessary that
<lb/>that the spirit have conqiered the world, ie the flesh, as did Jesus; but
<lb/>mankind is going towards that goal. God is beauty, truth and absolute kindness;
<lb/>towards them mankind advances, eA^en despite bad artists aid bad moralists.
<lb/>The time will come in which the Susanas have no need of veils, and old men will
<lb/>not feel their teirples burn because of ifesix such nudity.
<lb/>Again I find myself in the presence of the problem of shame. I read in the
<lb/>newspapers of the struggle enetered into by the members of the Artistic League,
<lb/>who take as their best models completely nude women, against the members of the
<lb/>Anti-vice league, who have Ì pealed to the authorities to prevent the sale of
<lb/>the productions of the Artistic League. All the greatest artists of America and
<lb/>Europe ridicule the efforts of the president of the Anti-vice League, asserting
<pb n="54" facs="#page-053"/>
<lb/>that he has taken the matter to its animal side, since there are welleducated
<lb/>American ladies â¢iho are gifted artists of the League, and who see their art not
<lb/>as an instrument of vice but as love of beauty, I think there is merit on both
<lb/>sides, given their respective positions^ what they shouM do is get together to
<lb/>choose the artists as w ell as the models. To copy the latter, artists need to be
<lb/>above their gross carnal appetites, which is somewhat hard to find, given the
<lb/>current moral state. On the other hand, human beauty is perhaps the most in5)or-
<lb/>tant part of art, and thus it deserves that artistic taste be educated by it.
<lb/>The president of the Anti-vice Society shotild cooperate with all his energy
<lb/>to educate the oublic in schools, making it understand the august fnHtnkaiHBt
<lb/>irr^ortance of the sexual functions. Only then will carnal appetites and tendencies
<lb/>be ruled by convictions.
<lb/>In the current state of civilization of the 20th century, what does sea
<lb/>bathing in the summer mean? For this American people, whi have inade a cult of
<lb/>of work which produces richness and prosperity, sea-bathing has been and is a
<lb/>pretext for relaxing, seeking out the breezes and seawater, combining the two
<lb/>joys of Nature with the artificial ones invented by human ingenuity. One needs to
<lb/>have gone to Atlantic City or Asbxiry Park to have felt the pulsations of that almost
<lb/>fever created by the habit id" sea-bathing. After the inclement W.after has passed,
<lb/>and -when the breezes of Spring have begun to Haxtroamldsx get warm with the summer's
<lb/>heat which awakens the life of Nature, it is not only the desite of breathing
<lb/>in the fresh sea-breezes that drags people to the beaches, but something else
<lb/>that bums in the veins of youth, especially, When history collects the data of
<lb/>the witnesses of today to pass them on to the posterity of the 30th century,
<lb/>it will have to tell the complete truth. In an era when the pleasures of the flesh
<lb/>prevailed over those of the spirit, it will say, hundreds of thousands of human
<lb/>beings, abandoning their ordinary clothes and adopting others which combined
<lb/>semi-nudity with the merest exigencies of shame, dashed off to the beach, both
<lb/>men a nd women, to stay there for hours on end, alternately submerging themselves
<lb/>in the cool waves and later lying down on the soft and warm sands of the shore,
<lb/>enjoying uninterruptedly that cblicjous exaltation of vitality. Imagine seeing in
<lb/>the immense panorama of the beach innumerable groups of pretty American girls
<lb/>with that wet suit stuck to their bodies, chatting and happily playing with
<lb/>athletic and well-formed youths fresh from the gyma of colleges and universities,
<lb/>and you will have a vague idea of what sea-bathing is all about. This pleasant
<lb/>habit has doubtlessbecome ai effective meais of socializing,for when the sun
<lb/>sets and inundates the sky with pretty shadows, which soon giveway to brilliant
<lb/>electric lights, salons and theaters open, and musicgi dancing and diversion
<lb/>are the sweet coroUaries of those playful waves which, with their ebb and flow,
<lb/>bathed thousands of hiuman bodies of both sexes 11 I think the ocean is a great
<lb/>and active caase of marriages in the United States and in Europe,
<lb/>It is 31 years toago today that in Ecuador, my homeland, there was taken off
<lb/>the stage of life President Garcia Moreno; 31 years that there is fulfilled for the
<lb/>timpteenth time that prophecy which history pu-^s into the mouth of Brutus, when
<lb/>he raised high the dagger stained with Caesar s blood: "Sic semper tyrannis','
<lb/>And who is a tyrant? In the last analysis it is a public evildoer, who, possessed
<lb/>of the foimidable power confided in him by the oublic s o that he will do the
<pb n="55" facs="#page-054"/>
<lb/>greatest good possible, enploys it precisely in doing all the evil he can.
<lb/>And does the public have the right to kill a man, even if he is a tyrant, when
<lb/>the Ten Commandments say terminantly: "Thou shalt not kill'.' ? The defenders of
<lb/>tyrannmcide answer with another question: "The man who finds himself, as one says,
<lb/>between the sword and the wall, absolutely unable to contain his aggressor other
<lb/>than by killing him, should he let himself be killed rather than kill?" It is an
<lb/>incontrovertible axiom that the first human right is self-preservation, and if
<lb/>this right has been violated by the tyrant or his associates, the public has no
<lb/>other remedy than to kill him. Not just great politicians and philosophers,
<lb/>but also great theologians have snadfcs: defended the doctrine of tyrannicide.
<lb/>VJhen the Latin writer, parising eloquence and its surprising effects upon
<lb/>the hearers, left us with the famous phrase "Contiquere omnes, intentique ora
<lb/>tenebanty (All were silent, and their mouths were open), he was probably very
<lb/>far from imagining that with the passage of the centuries there would come an
<lb/>orator, mute, but no less eloquent than the Roman, who would hold silent and
<lb/>openmouthed, I shant say the hearers for therelas nothing to hear, but thousands
<lb/>of onlookers in populous New York, and precisely at the hour when rivers of
<lb/>people are going to their daily work. That mute orator had the power to d etain in
<lb/>their steps those rivers of people to convince them of what the men of the 20th
<lb/>century were capable. The fact is that they were building the 25th floor of a
<lb/>big building in the busiest and most centrally located part of New York, and on
<lb/>that floor one could see a gi^at big crane at an altitude of about 300 feet, from
<lb/>which hung a wire cable used to cariy up the huge blocks of granite used to build
<lb/>the walls. Well, on one of those blocks of stone a man had been standing since
<lb/>it left the level of the street, and no passerby wanted to go on until he had
<lb/>seen that man reach that immense height, from where he seemed to have the dimensions
<lb/>of a doll. Here endeth the tale of the mute orator.
<lb/>Today on Broadway I saw a woman viio had the unmistakable signs of contusions
<lb/>on her face, her eyes swollen and livid, her look aad and her clothing poor and
<lb/>unkenpt. Feeling conplete compassion I exclaimed: "Poor woman, She has a brute
<lb/>of a husband, or the sad habit of drinking too much liquor, and in either case
<lb/>it is all wqrthy of the greatest pity. In the first case, if she is sufficiently
<lb/>resigned and prudent to endure the inevitable, she will have emerged triun5)hant
<lb/>in the terrible trial of outting up with a perhaps drunken husband who has
<lb/>sunk low enou^ to commit the cowardly act of brutal3Â®r beating a woman. In
<lb/>the second case, that is, that she herself has the degrading habit of getting
<lb/>drunk enough to lose her muscular equilibrium and suffer falls that leave her
<lb/>bruised and bloodied, it is still worse than the first case, for it reveals
<lb/>that she is the victim of an inherited or acquired propensity and that she has
<lb/>lacked an education capable of elevating her charatcter to combat that fatal
<lb/>tendency, M^be since childhood she was accustomed to just pray, and they did not
<lb/>make her aware of her double nature, the august mission of the woman, and that she
<lb/>shoulj choose very carefully, knoxdug deeply the character and the habits of the
<lb/>man she would choose as husband and father of her children.
<lb/>3*^ ofCrossing the corner of Broadway and Morris Street, I met a young of
<lb/>good appearance and about 30 years of age, who [leaning on two stout caies,
<lb/>could barely walk. It seemed the muscles of her waist were atrophied, or perhaps
<pb n="56" facs="#page-055"/>
<lb/>it was the beginnings of paralysis, and with a sorrowful inpression in my soul,
<lb/>I asked myself, parodying the disciples of Jesus in th e Gospel story of the
<lb/>blind man: "Who has sinned here, this pleasant young man or the parents?" Here
<lb/>is a case of morality which shakes closely the hand of science, in recognizing
<lb/>the awful effects of heredity. Many careless young people contaminate their bodies
<lb/>to the degree of causing incurable lesions, seized by their blind youthful
<lb/>ardor which seeks only pleasure, without reflecting that that cup, honeyed on its
<lb/>riki, hides in its bottom that treacherous poison, which after ruining the
<lb/>body is transmit ted even perhaps unto the third or fourth generation. From
<lb/>this the need for both parents and teachers to uMdscEfcskx undertake the task of
<lb/>instructing the young of both sexes in the laws which govern human generation,
<lb/>itxrax Nature has placed in that august physiological function the wellbeing and
<lb/>the happiness of the human species.
<lb/>Do you love the home, that is, do you love father, mother, sons, brothers?
<lb/>Until death, you will aiswer me. Well, widen that feeling and you will have that
<lb/>which is called homeland, that is, the home enlarged with all the charms of
<lb/>childhood, the affections of youth and the sweet recollections of old age,
<lb/>Man, at birth, upon taking the first breath of air into his lungs and uttering
<lb/>the first cry, which characterizes the planet wherein he will live, has also
<lb/>taken in all the conditions of the environment and identifies with it and loves
<lb/>it until death and even beyond, since the affections of the home and of the
<lb/>homeland must live as long as the spirit, that is, eternally. It does not matter
<lb/>that because of the vicissitudes of life a man must leave his home a nd his
<lb/>homeland; wherever he goes he carries with him and keeps alive in the deepest
<lb/>pait. of his soul the fire which that hand which is called destiny but which in
<lb/>reality is the Law, lit in his breast so that it could never die. That's why the
<lb/>word homeland causes enthusiasm, maddens, ennobles and makes heroes aid martyrs.
<lb/>For that reason my homeland on this day recalls with veneration its heroes
<lb/>and martyrs.
<lb/>Maiy sincere preachers are doggedly trying to convince people that all
<lb/>the evils which now weigh upon society and which threaten to worsen in the future
<lb/>are due to the lack of religion, which alone can radically cure all these evils,
<lb/>Recogniting their sincerity, and doing justice toiheir good and healthy intentions,
<lb/>one could still say to them: "Do you men of God perhaps think that that which
<lb/>you call religion, that is a mass a doctrines and dogmas you have invented comple
<lb/>tely forgetting and even at times contrary to the teaching os Christ, that you
<lb/>can heal those ills which you deplore and idiich you yourselves have helped create
<lb/>with those same doctrines and dogmas? Jesus gave no other example nor left any other
<lb/>rule beyond brotherly love, and you preach and practice hatred, cruel and intran-
<lb/>sigeant, and you have started religious wars and arefeciting people to rebel
<lb/>against laws and governments, allegedly in the name of Ha Tdio died on the cross,
<lb/>pleading before His father for His murderers]
<lb/>Today I have seen realized in practice that noble Spanish saying: "Love
<lb/>is repaid with love'.' Two handsome and well built young men were pushing a three-
<lb/>wheeled chair along the paths of the rose garden in Prospect Park, in which there
<lb/>sat a venebable old lady -tdiom I assumed was their grandmother. Mien I saw the
<pb n="57" facs="#page-056"/>
<lb/>wstrni affetction vith which sheras treated, how they tried to make her rolling
<lb/>tour agreeable, explaining to her, giving her the names of the various roses
<lb/>and other flowers in the garden, I was moved pleasantly by this scene of filial
<lb/>affection, a nd I thought that it was more than likely that when this old 3a dy
<lb/>still had the use of her legs, she must have pushed, perhaps along these very
<lb/>paths, the carriages of her children and grandchildren. That's how it should be
<lb/>in the world, for love is repaid with love.
<lb/>A great modern writer has said that the home thd&gt; had nothing to reproach
<lb/>itself for could have walls and roof made of Ì ss. Well, parodying that writer,
<lb/>it could well be said that giving children and young people the highest moral
<lb/>education is the same as building for the future a city mf glass, or what is the
<lb/>same, to build homes whose habits can be seen by the whole world. When a man
<lb/>has raised his moral level, his thoughts and actions are x-ray proof, for he has
<lb/>nothing to hide of which he could be ahhamed. When society has reached this height,
<lb/>human beings could even be trahsparent.
<lb/>When I come across a father or a mother who has dedicated ail love and
<lb/>tenderness to his or her children, even at the cost pf his or her own sacrifice,
<lb/>and when I measure those same sentiments which have tied me to own, the
<lb/>wondrous figure of Jesus takes on for me gigantic proportions in his redeeming
<lb/>gfforts for humanity. No well meaning philosopher of the human species coild
<lb/>have given to the reliationship betxreen man and God the characteristics and attri
<lb/>butes of paternity and maternity, and on that axle turns and daily grows the
<lb/>work of Jesus, The paternity and maternity of God and the brotherhood of all mankind
<lb/>abound in the Gospel, And that ferment of 'viiich He spoke and which He left in
<lb/>the mass of humanity is transforming it incessantly, and one d ay all men will
<lb/>eat of that celestial bread, which is nothing more than the love of the Father
<lb/>for all His children. Let us imagine for a moment that the sentiments which today
<lb/>prevail in the hoirÂ® were to become aistamaBdCDiK part of the entire human species.
<lb/>We would have an idea, however vague, of what the kingdom of God will be like.
<lb/>The Popes, forgetting the clear and express teaching of Jesus that the things
<lb/>of the Earth, like money, belong to Caesar, and those of the heavens, like truth,
<lb/>justice, humility, abnegation belong to God, have made Caesars of themselves,
<lb/>and on top of the religious crown they thought to wear have placed the crown of
<lb/>politics and have had themselves proclaimed kings. To hold on to this purely
<lb/>worldly crown they have had need of armies and navies, and among many others
<lb/>those of the French Empire supported the Pope-king, But in 1870 the Germans
<lb/>Bismarck and von Moltke topple the French Enpire, Then in Italy Cavour and
<lb/>Garibaldi take advantage of thab opportunity to end the teii5)oral rule of the Popes
<lb/>and set up the current united Kingdom of Italy. Since then the 8Kp^Â±iExizf people of
<lb/>France, made wise, sets up a nevr and powerful Republic which has needed 36 years
<lb/>of patient and wise organization to rid itself in its tum of that old temporal,
<lb/>not spiritual, power which for centuries has weighed upon the French consciousness
<lb/>in the name of religion, promulgating a law which separates and defines the church
<lb/>and the State, But see, that yesterday the Pope has published an encyclical to the
<lb/>French clergy inciting resistance to that law and sowing discord among brothers.
<lb/>All clear and honorable minds will see in that incitement and completely unchristian
<lb/>rebellion.

<lb/>I have just read on t he blackboard of the Evening Mail the news of cruel
<lb/>murders and riots in Russia, the inpotent stinggles of that people to overthrow
<lb/>the Autocracy, and I thought to myself: "The tajne of kings is over',' Shortly
<lb/>before the appearance of Cbrist in the world, the poets of that time were
<lb/>saying: "The time of gids is overjf and in fact, not too much later paganism
<lb/>fell ffiut and the gods were truly gone. Seeing the news item I mentioned, I could
<lb/>not help exclaiming, though I am neither a poet or a prophet, "The time of kings
<lb/>is overV Of the European monarchies, the (nnly absooute one is that of Russia,
<lb/>but one can already hear buzzing through the air that little stone which will
<lb/>land at the clay feet of that colossus of the North, A bit longer, and the kings
<lb/>will have gone, as the gods did, never to r eturn. The other monarchies of
<lb/>Europe are not even a shadow of what they were in past times. The people have
<lb/>grown a great deal and in leaving their minority behind they're grasping the
<lb/>scepter which is theirs by rights: look at France as the living proof of ray
<lb/>assertion.Mien the Hebrews asked Jehovah for a king, this was granted them,
<lb/>but with the warning that they would somiday have to deplore the evil they
<lb/>requested.
<lb/>OhJ-y a short time after there occurred a disatrous earthquake in Valparaiso,
<lb/>it has been known in New York and while deploring such a hopeless catastrophe,
<lb/>my thoughts were drawn to consider the great progress humanity has made in the
<lb/>last century. If this disaster had occurred in 18D6, the fatal news would have
<lb/>taken 8 to 10 months to reach New York by sailing ship, travelling either by
<lb/>the Straits of Magellan or dfcina after crossing the Isthms of Panama. Fifty
<lb/>years later it would have arrived in perhaps as little as a month by steamship.
<lb/>Today this news reaches us almost the same moment it occurs by undergiound
<lb/>cable or tRitwgffwpkifiKirwxx the wireless. It will not be long from now that that
<lb/>communication will be almost instantaneous, by way of thought transmission,
<lb/>and mankind walks towards that. And something even more wondrous will happen
<lb/>when mankind has advanced to a high degree of spirituality, and has been able
<lb/>to make good use of communication with invisible intelligences which c an foresee
<lb/>and predict natural phenomena before they occur. Pelletan was right: "The
<lb/>world marches onl'
<lb/>I often hear it asked why poor children are healthier and are more robust
<lb/>than those of the rich. Well, for a very simple reason. Poor children run around
<lb/>almost naked and the iii5)ortant functions of the skin are not impeded by too many
<lb/>iTtyfflTnxjafiiimtffflgnraS: clothes, clothes, usually of rich cloths, that are tightfitting
<lb/>and which tend to obstruct the proper circulation of the blood. Also, poor
<lb/>children are more exposed to the sudden changes of the weather and are more used
<lb/>to them, thereby avoiding colds, pneumonia, etc. Poor children eat simple food,
<lb/>often half-raw, with no indigestible seasonings; their very poverty prevents them
<lb/>from buying and filling up on sweets and other goodies delightful to the palate
<lb/>but harmful to the digestion. Poor children run around, jxmp up and down and do
<lb/>all soils of exercise in the fresh air of the streets and squares, filling their
<lb/>lungs with fresh and vivifying air, whereas the rich keep their children shut up
<lb/>in splendid caipeted apartments, with shutters and drapes th#, inpede the passage
<lb/>of light and air, elements vital for human nature. That's why dl you have to do is
<pb n="59" facs="#page-058"/>
<lb/>take rich children outside and they catch cold, and live infirm, pale and
<lb/>rickety despite all their wealth. Bad health and a weak body have an influence
<lb/>on the intelligencej they dull it, and poor children are almost always more
<lb/>intelligent than rich ones.
<lb/>I live with my family in this city of Brooklyn in a district vflaere there
<lb/>are a lot of Italians, and above all southern Italians, and my wife, returning
<lb/>from her morning walk, says to me: "These Italians may have all the faults one can
<lb/>mention, but they have the great virtue of work. Each morning when I go out
<lb/>early, they're the fio^st people I see getting ready for work. And, you know,
<lb/>it's the same with the Chinese and the Blacks. You will have seen on the squares
<lb/>and docks of New Yorkj "^whose benches are almost always occupied by people
<lb/>wit^ut work, either because they're lazy or because they refuse to get into the
<lb/>habit of working at all, you never see any Itsiians, Chinese or Blacks, which goes
<lb/>to show thSt those peoples are very industrious, and whab a pity it is that they
<lb/>are looked upon with such disdain everywhere'.' lanswered"Thank you for your thwtagfiiis,
<lb/>observation, because with it you have helped me plane my shaving for today,
<lb/>viiich I'll set down right now. You are certainly correct in your observations,
<lb/>and if in Italy, China or Africa those men found the sociological conditions
<lb/>they find in other lands, they would not emigrate in search of them, and they
<lb/>wpuld make their native lands progress marvelously. But the world is set up in
<lb/>such a way that these seeming aberrations, unjust ones, of Nature are not, but
<lb/>are in fact her bull's eyes, because they serve to mix and combine all the races,
<lb/>so that all characters will also be mixed together and mankind will be put to the

<lb/>There are sounds which waken in the soiil different memories and impressions,

<lb/>the li|th floor of a tall building on Bowling Green, my earS receive the high
<lb/>notes of the voice of a boy who is selling something on the s treets below, in
<lb/>Battery Park's pathways, and I thought sadly: poor boy. without realizing it
<lb/>he is fulfilling with those cries the mission he has imposed pn himself. He
<lb/>perhaps has a sick mother to feed at the cost of those high and sad notes he
<lb/>draws from his vocal cords. Perhaps in another life that boy was the brutal
<lb/>husband ofthat loving woman, who has today elevated herself even more by dedi
<lb/>cating to him her maternal love, and the bread with which that boy calms the
<lb/>hunger of his mother represents the advanced step that spirit has take n along

<lb/>Mr. Roosevelt calls the social crime which Emile Zola denounced to the

<lb/>Isn't it true that such an unfortunate being would cease to exist after a few

<lb/>Yesterday I lost Lucila, a 13 month old granddaughter, who was the KfearmxHf
<lb/>delight of her parents and the happiness of her grandparents (The first Lucile - Ed,)
<lb/>Robust and full of life, she seemed destined to be a grandmother in her turn,
<lb/>but a microscopic animal biologists call a bacterium, reproducing perhaps by the
<lb/>millions, devoured her intestines and fredd her spirit after she had suffered

<lb/>that which a skeptic would call a perfidioys deed, of destroying in less than

<lb/>was all a fiasco, a crushing deception to have created only to destroy right away,
<lb/>with apparently no hnioaimfimnifeiEnpc social function, no human mission accom
<lb/>plished? Why are children born so pretty, and why di they die so soon? Why
<lb/>xmxjiiyiti'hmKiiK did the lively and happy spirit of Lucila, filled with life and with
<lb/>graces in a healthy and robust body, like a bird of passage in a foreign land
<lb/>come to perch in my home, only to fly away leaving her cage cold and sad anidst the
<lb/>indellible memories of her passage? Is it perhaps a divine pleasure to create
<lb/>only to destroy? (Olmedo) Oh no. According to moddrn science,^he birth and death
<lb/>of children is realized a complementary life^ that is, Lucila in her earlier
<lb/>existence died before her time because of some more or less punishable
<lb/>cause, and she was morally obliged to choose my home to couplete thtt existence,
<lb/>suffering herself in expiation and causing us to suffer as a trial.
<lb/>Every day that it falls to me to be part of those great waves of people
<lb/>who from all over converge on the Brooklyn Bridge in pursuit of their daily
<lb/>occupations in New York, I an more and more convinced how healthy it is for a
<lb/>co-untry to be infected with the disease of work. Just as humans Ì Ee infected
<lb/>by fashions, habits, the worries and fanaticisms harmful to human progress,
<lb/>so too can they be infected with the germs of civilization. Put yourselves in
<lb/>contact with lazy people who, on the pretext of religion, spend all day inside
<lb/>a church, attracted there by the charms of those who say they are its ministers,
<lb/>and you too xd-ll get into the habit of wasting your time on things of mo use to
<lb/>anyone. But live in a society that is animated by thefever of work, aid by that
<lb/>enthusiasm for inventions useful for life, and you will feel the healthy
<lb/>attraction of work and you will be carried along in that healthy and beneficial

<lb/>Do you want proof, a sad but unequivocal proof, that humanity has yet to
<lb/>leave the age of foolishness? Well then, there you have these so-called maneuversy
<lb/>the descriptions of which have filled the columns of the newspapers. Now men are
<lb/>not ireally killing eachother, but merely entertaining themselves with simulated
<lb/>killing. Kings, eirperors, presidents, they all fill with pride at witnessing
<lb/>these simulations, and there might even be some neurotic ones among them who
<lb/>are desirous of carrying them into reality on any pretext. Do you know just what
<lb/>these maneuvers, precursors of war, really are? Nothing less than a senseless
<lb/>waste of the riches produced by thg people. In every country of the world the
<lb/>Army and Navy budgets are monstruous, terrifying, and made up from the labors
<lb/>of the subjects, or citizens. Meanwhile, daily attengsts are madee to cut those
<lb/>for Education and Welfare, Ifery will probably laugh at hearing me decry this
<lb/>waste which is not only useless but hannful. And they would be right, for I
<lb/>spesk of a period in which common sense will predominate over the baser passions.
<lb/>I read in the newspapers the news, received by cable, that the Czar has
<lb/>decided to give the Phissian peasants several million acres of land, belonging
<lb/>to the crown, in the hope of silencing the revolutionary agitation which is
<lb/>menacing the throne. Upon reading that news I said to myself :'*Hlth this deed
<lb/>Nicholas II of Russia has shotm that he has taken the first steps towaixJs
<lb/>honesty and integrity of conscience. It is not a gift that the Czar has made, but
<lb/>merely a restitution," And right away there came into my mind the doctrine of the
<lb/>great modem thinkem, especially Proudhon, that is that the appropriation of land
<lb/>is a true usurpation, so perfectly organized t hsrt it will continue for many years
<lb/>more clothed with the false veils of legality and respected as an inviolable right,
<lb/>until the reorganization of society. When our descendants of the 30bh centuiy read
<lb/>afcftutthis gift that the Czar has just made of crown lands, they will burst out
<lb/>laughing and will conclude by feeling pity for their grandparents of t he 20th, who
<lb/>had innocently sanctioned as sacred the most odious of usurpations. The land ie
<lb/>not something which can be appropriated, for man can only truly licitly appropriate
<lb/>that which is produced by his labors. Let it be known, then, that there are some
<lb/>of us here today who protests gainst the posterity of the illnamed idea of property.
<lb/>Silence and solitude are the most appropriate conditions for meditation and for
<lb/>entering into communication with the intelligences that people the invisiblas world.
<lb/>Inspiration is almost never attained in the din and confusion of streets and public
<lb/>squares, but rather in the silent retirement of poets, philospphers, scientists
<lb/>and the benefactors of mankind. It is because the vibrations of thought are infinitely
<lb/>more subtle than the vocal ones, or those of light, electricity and other physical
<lb/>fluids. For that reason you will also have heard it said that the most surprising
<lb/>phenomena that scientists are discovering in their psychiatric investigations, are
<lb/>attained in subdued light, or better yet in darkness, because the vibrations of
<lb/>light do not affect the those of the soul. Saints have had their visions ffrodn^irfc
<lb/>and apparitions amidst the silent quietude of their spirit, for the spiritual and
<lb/>ethereal world needs those conditions to manifest itself.
