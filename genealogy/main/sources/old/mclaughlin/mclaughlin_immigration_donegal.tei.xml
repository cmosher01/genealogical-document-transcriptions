<lb/>Dear Christopher
<lb/>The initial assessment has now been carried out on your behalf and a preliminary report
<lb/>of our findings is enclosed for your consideration.
<lb/>I wish to apologise for the delay, which was caused by an increase in the number of
<lb/>enquiries to our centre.
<lb/>You will note from the preliminary report that for the most part the parish and civil
<lb/>registers do not date back to the relevant period. This may be due to the conditions,
<lb/>which prevailed in Ireland in the late 18"* and early 19^ centuries. The absence of
<lb/>records is common, particularly in the case of members of the Catholic Church.
<lb/>You will note that our researcher conducted extensive searches of the sources available
<lb/>at this centre and we have uncovered records, which may be of relevance. In the
<lb/>absence of parish records it is difficult to positively identify them as relevant to your
<lb/>ancestors. I regret that no conclusive information has emerged from our searches.
<lb/>Should you have any further queries or seek clarification on any matter, please do not
<lb/>hesitate to contact me.
<lb/>Kind regards.
<lb/>Yours sincerely

<lb/>PRELIMINARY REPORT
<lb/>Name: William McLaughlin
<lb/>Date of Birth: Possibly L'May 1821 or 1825
<lb/>Place of Birth: Unknown, County Donegal
<lb/>Denomination: Probably Catholic
<lb/>We have now completed our initial assessment regarding the feasibility of carrying out
<lb/>research on your family ancestors and the following is a list of the sources consulted.
<lb/>Surname Variants:
<lb/>The surname McLaughlin is a variant of the standard surname MacLoughlin. Other
<lb/>variations include MacLaughlin, McLaughlan, McLoughlan and McLoughlin. The
<lb/>surname Dougherty is a variant of the standard surname Doherty. Other variations
<lb/>include Docherty, Dogherty and O'Doherty. All variations of the surnames have been
<lb/>taken into consideration during this search. Until the start of the twentieth century, for
<lb/>the vast majority of families in Ireland, the question of the precise spelling of their
<lb/>surnames was completely irrelevant. Local accents, translation and anglicisation of
<lb/>Irish names, illiteracy, poverty and lack of standard spelling all combined to produce an
<lb/>enormous range of variations on what are basically the same surnames. Names
<lb/>changed from generation to generation, in the same generation and even in the records
<lb/>of the same individual.
<lb/>Householders Index:
<lb/>We commenced our investigation by consulting the Householders Index to establish
<lb/>the number and location of McLaughlin properties in County Donegal
<lb/>This index was compiled from Griffith's Primary Valuation (1857-1858) and the Tithe
<lb/>Applotment Books (1824-1838).
<lb/>McLaughlin and Doherty are two of the most commonly used surnames in County
<lb/>Donegal and this is reflected in the fact that according to this index there were there
<lb/>were eight hundred and twenty-eight McLaughlin and one thousand seven hundred and
<lb/>seventy-five Doherty properties listed through out Donegal The distribution of these
<lb/>properties by barony is as follows:
<lb/>McLaughlin Inishowen East [484], Inishowen West [104], Boylagh [4],
<lb/>Raphoe North [51], Raphoe South [49], Banagh [34],
<lb/>Tirhugh [19] and Kilmacrenan [83].
<lb/>Family Research /CAM/6
<pb n="3" facs="#page-002"/><lb/>Donegal Ancestry
<lb/>Doherty/Dougherty Inishowen East [828], Inishowen West [18],
<lb/>Boylagh [56], Raphoe North [97], Raphoe South
<lb/>[120], Banagh [90], Tirhugh [344] and
<lb/>Kilmacrenan [222],
<lb/>An attached explanatory sheet describes the administrative divisions used in Ireland.
<lb/>These include baronies, civil parishes and townlands.
<lb/>Griffith's Primary Valuation:
<lb/>Arranged by groups of parishes in Poor Law Unions. This source gives the names of
<lb/>owners and occupiers of both buildings and land from which the above index was
<lb/>compiled.
<lb/>It is possible that William McLaughlin's father James was the owner or occupier of
<lb/>land at the time of this survey. We continued by conducting a search of this source
<lb/>and located eighty-two entries for properties held in the name of James McLaughlin in
<lb/>various locations throughout the county. It is not possible to connect any of these
<lb/>records to your ancestors.
<lb/>Tithe Applotment Books:
<lb/>The Composition Act of 1823 specified that tithes due to the Established Church, the
<lb/>Church of Ireland, which had hitherto been payable in kind, should now be paid in
<lb/>money. As a result, it was necessary to carry out a valuation of the entire country,
<lb/>civil parish by civil parish, to determine how much would be payable by each
<lb/>landowner. This was done over the ensuing fifteen years, up to the abolition of tithes
<lb/>in 1838. We hold a copy of these books for County Donegal on microfilm.
<lb/>A further search of this source is not recommended as it will not be possible to be sure
<lb/>of the relevance of anv records uncovered.
<lb/>Passenger Lists:
<lb/>We have available a list of passengers sailing from Londonderry to the US/Canada on
<lb/>the J. &amp; J. Cooke Line and the McCorkell Line from 1847 to 1871. We also hold a list
<lb/>of passengers sailing from Ireland and Liverpool between 1803 and 1855.
<lb/>A search of this source uncovered nineteen records in the name of William McLaughlin
<lb/>from Donegal who emigrated between 1849 and 1860. In the absence of more
<lb/>information regarding the place of origin of William it is not possible to be sure of the
<lb/>relevance of any of these records.

<lb/>Donegal Ancestry
<lb/>Church Records;
<lb/>Before state registration of births, marriages and deaths in 1864, virtually the only
<lb/>direct sources of family information are local parish registers. In general, Church of
<lb/>Ireland parish registers pre-date Presbyterian and Roman Catholic records. For the
<lb/>most part, how far back a family can be traced depends on the dates of the surviving
<lb/>parish registers for the area.
<lb/>While most Roman Catholic registers start in the latter half of the nineteenth century,
<lb/>some registers in the more prosperous areas have survived from much earlier, but a
<lb/>large number of these were destroyed in the PubUc Records Office fire of 1922.
<lb/>Enclosed is a list of church registers for County Donegal together with a list of those
<lb/>currently available at this centre. You will note that for the most part the Catholic
<lb/>Church registers commence in the mid 1800's and so are too late to contain reference
<lb/>to the birth/baptism of William McLaughlin or his siblings and the marriage of his
<lb/>parents.
<lb/>As the Established Church, the Church of Ireland, claimed the right to administer
<lb/>baptism, marriages and burial ceremonies and in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
<lb/>centuries especially, due to prevailing laws, the records of births, marriages and deaths
<lb/>of other denominations are often found in the registers of the Church of Ireland
<lb/>A full search of all records currently available on our database failed to locate any
<lb/>reference to William McLaughlin, his siblings or his parents.
<lb/>Gravestone Inscriptions:
<lb/>We hold a number of gravestone inscriptions from various graveyards around the
<lb/>County. A search of this uncovered several McLaughlin entries however it is not
<lb/>possible to be sure of the relevance of any of these records.
<lb/>Civil Records:
<lb/>State registration of all births, marriages and deaths began in Ireland in 1864; non-
<lb/>Roman Catholic marriages are registered from 1845.
<lb/>County Donegal is divided into 52 civil parishes and by nine Poor Law Unions, namely
<lb/>Ballyshannon, Donegal, Glenties, Stranorlar, Dunfanaghy, Letterkenny, IVfilford, Deny
<lb/>and Inishowen. Each of these Unions is further divided into Dispensary Districts.
<lb/>There are forty registration districts in the county.
<lb/>It is possible that the parents of William McLaughlin died after 1864 but again without
<lb/>knowing where in Donegal your ancestor resided it is not possible to carry out a search
<lb/>of the civil death registers.

<lb/>Donegal Ancestry
<lb/>Census Records:
<lb/>The earliest surviving Census return for County Donegal is the 1901 Census. This lists
<lb/>all those present in the household on the night of the Census (31st March 1901), their
<lb/>relationship to the householder, religion, occupation, age and other details.
<lb/>The 1911 Census is now available on microfilm.
<lb/>In the absence of more information regarding the place of origin of
<lb/>William McLaughlin it would not be possible to make any connection between your
<lb/>ancestor and the numerous McLaughlin families in these sources.

<lb/>Administrative Divisions
<lb/>Civil parish
<lb/>This is the most widely used land division. The civil parish, in use since the I?"'
<lb/>centur}', was based on monastic and church settlements and used extensively in
<lb/>surveys. This division generally coincides with the Church of Ireland parishes. There
<lb/>are fifty-two civil parishes in County Donegal. (See attached Map).
<lb/>Records compiled by civil parish include: Hearth Money Rolls, 19''' century Census
<lb/>Records, Tithe Books, Griffith's Valuation.
<lb/>Bni'onv
<lb/>Civil parishes are collected together to form baronies. This term originated in Celtic
<lb/>Ireland from the tribal land divisions of the tiiatha. This is now an obsolete division,
<lb/>but in the 19''' century it wms widely used. There are eight baronies in Donegal -
<lb/>Inishowen East and West, Kilmacrennan, Boylagh, Banagh, Tirhugh and Raphoe
<lb/>North and South. Records organised by barony include the 17''' centuiy surveys, early
<lb/>19''' century Tithe Books and mid 19'" century Griftlth's Valuation.
<lb/>Records organised by barony include: 17'" century sur\-eys, 19"' centuiy Tithe Books,
<lb/>Griffith's Valuation.
<lb/>Poor Law Union
<lb/>Under the Poor Relief Act, 1838, Ireland was divided into districts or Unions in \vhich
<lb/>the local rateable inhabitants were to be financially responsible for the care of all
<lb/>paupers in their areas. By 1850, 163 workhouses were built throughout the country.
<lb/>7'hese workhouses were usually situated in a large market town and served
<lb/>surrounding parishes and townlands, in many cases they ignored existing boundaries
<lb/>of parishes and counties. Land divisions within Poor Law Unions were divided into
<lb/>Dispensary Districts in which a dispensary and a doctor was located. After civil
<lb/>registration began in 1864 these Dispensary Districts also became Registrars Districts.
<lb/>The Registrar was responsible for collecting all the registrations of births, marriages
<lb/>and deaths within each District.
<lb/>Records organised by Poor Law Union include: Indexes to civil births, marriages and
<lb/>deaths, GiilTitli's Valuation,
<lb/>Town land
<lb/>The townland is the smallest and most ancient administrative division of land. It
<lb/>usually referred to a landmark strongly associated with a locality, ie, a mountain, a
<lb/>bog, a village, a church or a fort. It is usually what most researchers try to identify
<lb/>when carrying out genealogical research. Townlands are grouped together to form
<lb/>civil parishes. The number of townlands within a parish may differ greatly from one
<lb/>parish to another.

<lb/>The National Archives has customs passenger lists dating back to 1820 with a few as early as 1787, Lists prior to 1820 that are not at
<lb/>the National Archives may be on file at the port of entry or the State archives In the State where the port is located. The Morton Allan
<lb/>Directory of European Passenger Steamship Arrivals may be useful in determining the name and arrival date of ships arriving at New
<lb/>York, 1890â1930, and Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston, 1904â1926.
<lb/>Please fill In as much of the information called for above as possible. We will advise you if the information is inadequate to enable us to
<lb/>locate the entry you are seeking.
<lb/>We do not maintain a list of persons who do research for a fee; however, many researchers advertise their services in genealogical
<lb/>periodicals, usually available in libraries.

<lb/>â¡ A SEARCH WAS NOT MADE FOR THE REASON INDICATED:
<lb/>1. Our index to New York passenger arrivals covers the periods 1820 â 1846 and 1897 â
<lb/>1943. We regret that we cannot undertake a page-by-page search of the lists for the
<lb/>period between 1847 â 1896, inclusive.
<lb/>2. Masters of vessels departing from U.S. ports were not required to list the names of
<lb/>passengers. Therefore, we would not have a list for the passenger you have cited.
<lb/>3. Our holdings of passenger lists do not include any for Pacific coast ports. The San
<lb/>Francisco passenger lists were destroyed by fires in 1851 and 1940. (Consult the two
<lb/>works by Louis J. Pasmussen, San Francisco Ship Passenger Lists, 4 vols., 1965; and
<lb/>Railway Passenger Lists of Overland Trains to San Francisco and the West, 1 vol., 1966.)
<lb/>4. Overland arrivals into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico are notdocumented in passenger
<lb/>list records.
<lb/>5. Justice Department restrictions prohibit us from making searches in Immigration and
<lb/>Naturalization records less than 50 years old. We suggest that you direct an inquiry to:
<lb/>District Director, Immigration and Naturalization Service, New York, NY 10007.

<lb/>PASSENGER LISTS IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES
<lb/>1. We found several entries for persons of the same name arriving at the same port during the same period. Additional . '
<lb/>information, such as age, occupationâetc., will help in resolving this problem.
<lb/>:.w;
<lb/>2. We found the requested information on the passenger index, but we regret that the corresponding passenger list
<lb/>is missing. A copy of the index card is enclosed. , i
<lb/>3. We are unable to locate the passenger list for the ship listed and have found no entry on the passenger index for the
<lb/>requested party at that port. hJ-
<lb/>â¡
<lb/>n
<lb/>4. We examined the passenger list for the requested-shipand were unable to find an entry Tor the-requested passenger,â
<lb/>5. The register of ship arrivals did not show any entry for the ship named. ' â¢ -
<lb/>6. Our only passenger lists for the cited port do not cover the date that you have requested, and we were unable to
<lb/>find an entry on the index to the l ists we have. Â£-4 ^
<lb/>7. You may find some help in the book Irish and Scotch-Irish Ancestral Research by Margaret Dickson Falley (1962).
<lb/>It is a guide to genealogical records and repositories in Ireland and is normally available in larger libraries.
<lb/>8. Passports are issued to persons leaving the U.S., not arriving but early arrivals are frequently documented in passen
<lb/>ger lists, which are described in the enclosed leaflet.
<lb/>9. The National Archives has abstracts of Naturalization proceedings for the New England States (1787 â 1906) and
<lb/>the District of Columbia (1802 â 1926). For information about citizenship granted elsewhere before September
<lb/>27, 1906, send inquiries to the clerk of the Federal, State, or other court that issued the naturalization certificate.
<lb/>The Immigration and Natural ization Service, Washington, DC 20536, can furnish information on natural izations
<lb/>that occurred after September 26, 1906.
<lb/>10. It should be noted that the passenger l ists in our custody do not represent a complete collection. Some passenger
<lb/>lists of the 19th century were either lost or destroyed by dampness, fire, and other causes before records of this
<lb/>type were deposited in the National Archives.
