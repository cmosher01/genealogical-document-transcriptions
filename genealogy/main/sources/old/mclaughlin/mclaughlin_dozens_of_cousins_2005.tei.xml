<lb/>Forward
<lb/>The following was taken from a prior version of Dozens of Cousins written by Shirley
<lb/>Frost Regan in September, 1974.
<lb/>"How many times have you heard: "I know we're cousins, but how come?" Well, back in
<lb/>1957 I wondered the same thing, so I started investigating the family history. Several years
<lb/>before, Florence McLaughlin Frost had compiled the information but there was only one copy,
<lb/>and some historian along the way had misplaced it. I started with three of our ancestors on
<lb/>Page 1 who were most helpful: Kathryn McLaughlin Hendrick, Catherine Hendrick
<lb/>McLaughlin and Charles Touhey. From them I received the basic outline. The rest was
<lb/>obtained from many living McLaughlin's â and dates on tombstones!
<lb/>I set up three duplicate notebooks, arranged so that pages can be inserted for many
<lb/>generations to come. Then, we decided to have a printer make up a booklet. This was
<lb/>distributed in 1958. Since then, many moons and one disastrous flood have come and gone.
<lb/>So have most of the booklets! Since there was a great deal of data to be added, it was
<lb/>suggested that a new history be written. Now, after two years of procrastination on my
<lb/>partâand several years of inflation on the part of the economyâ a less expensive revision is
<lb/>herein presented. These are Xerox copies and will be easy to duplicate at any time.
<lb/>That's the story, but, as usual, I'd like to add a few personal comments. First of all, the
<lb/>research was rewarding. I now knew from what branch of the family tree I had fallen. And I
<lb/>also knew how come the Touhey's, Keenan's et al, were my cousins.
<lb/>Secondly, it brings back a smile from my memory bank. I was being "courted" by James
<lb/>H. Regan at the time and I'm sure he felt that poking around cemeteries â looking for my
<lb/>ancestorsâ was an exciting Saturday afternoon date!
<lb/>Above all, though, I wish that this younger generationâ and those to comeâ had been as
<lb/>fortunate as I was in knowing almost all the people in this booklet. The names and dates are
<lb/>here, but the warmth of their personalities cannot be put on paper. The McLaughlin's were
<lb/>industrious, witty, honest, wonderful descendants of Irish immigrants of the 19* century. They
<lb/>were â and are â an important part of our American heritage. I'm proud to be one of 'em!"
<lb/>Shirley Frost Regan
<lb/>Fast forward to 2005 and you now have a computer generated booklet created from a
<lb/>program that Shirley would have loved. John Morovich was instrumental in getting the
<lb/>information into the Family Tree Maker format back in 1997, and it has been my job to up
<lb/>date, print and distribute the end result. I, too, can attribute procrastination as the reason it has
<lb/>taken so long. So glad it runs in the family!!
<lb/>Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to contribute their time, knowledge, and
<lb/>family information. If I named everyone instrumental in getting this project done I'd probably
<lb/>forget someone and then be in big trouble.
<lb/>If you have additions, corrections or deletions that need to be made, you can drop me a
<lb/>note via e-mail at www.CarollOl 1 l@.iuno.com.
