<lb/>Dear Mr. Justice,
<lb/>I am an amateur genealogist trying to trace my family history, and I have run across an ancestor with
<lb/>the Justice name, who lived in New Bern in the 1800s. I'm writing to you in hopes that you might
<lb/>be related to my ancestor.
<lb/>My great-grandfather was Harry Hamilton Disosway. His parents were Israel Disosway and Anne
<lb/>Mariah Justice. I have checked the US Census records from 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880 for New
<lb/>Bern. These records indicate that Anne Mariah Justice was born around 1827; she had a sister
<lb/>named Elizabeth Justice (who was born around 1817); Anne married Israel Disosway around 1855
<lb/>(Israel ran a drug store); and together they had 6 children:
<lb/>John (Israel?) Disosway
<lb/>Reginald Justice Disosway
<lb/>Harry Hamilton Disosway
<lb/>Emma (or Annie) Disosway
<lb/>Clarence Disosway
<lb/>John Disosway
<lb/>(born c1856)
<lb/>(born cl857)
<lb/>(born 1861)
<lb/>(born cl863)
<lb/>(born cl867)
<lb/>(born cl869)
<lb/>If you by any chance are related to Anne Mariah Justice, or have any information that might help
<lb/>me, please write back and let me know. I am most interested in finding out who her parents were,
<lb/>and tracing her ancestry back as far as possible. Thank you very much for your help.
<lb/>Sincerely,
<lb/>Chris Mosher

<lb/>Dear Chris Mosher,
<lb/>I regret that I am unable to help you in
<lb/>locating information pertaining to Anne Mariah
<lb/>Justice. I am not a native of this area. I
<lb/>relocated here jfrqm Rew Jersejr jn _1^2_. T
<lb/>know another Justice that works in a store I
<lb/>patronize and I will show him your letter the
<lb/>next time I see him. Maybe he will be able to
<lb/>help you.
<lb/>Sincerely,
<lb/>Wilson L. Justic
